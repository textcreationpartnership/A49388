            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Am not ignorant, that Dedications and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, if they have in them a genius of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if they ſparkle with Wit and Fancy; if they be enriched with Senſe, and animated by moving and vital Language, are like graceful Acceſſes, and beautiful Fronts to Buildings; which while they raiſe in the Beholder a ſecret Delight, do prepoſſeſs him with favourable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of them: But this being only a Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a former Treatiſe, and having little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement either from my Humor or Talents to any attempt of that kind, I never ſuffer my ſelf to be unneceſſarily ingaged in it, I will therefore in this place only give a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I have performed in the firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and deſign in this: In the <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter I ſhewed that Happineſs was neither ſo great and divine a poſſeſſion as to be above the Ambition of Man, nor ſo inconſiderable, as not to deſerve it: And next that it was not to be expected
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39250:6"/>
from Time or Chance, Fancy or Inclination; but from Reaſon and Induſtry, Vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> having firſt briefly ſtated the Notion of Happineſs, I endeavoured to demonſtrate the poſſibility of obtaining it, and to reſcue ſo important an Opinion from the Prejudices and Objections that might ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle and oppreſs it. In the <hi>third,</hi> I juſt point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Cauſes of humane miſery, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs in this Enquiry, and the Remedies of it.</p>
               <p>Having thus removed whatever might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or fruſtrate our Endeavours after Happineſs, I am now to proceed to a more ſtrict and particular Examination of the Nature of it, and the Ways and Methods that lead to it. In which I am obliged, according to the General Deſign or Scheme laid down in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Volume, to treat of <hi>Life, Perfection, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence,</hi> and <hi>Fruition,</hi> accordingly I here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Life, and dividing this Book into three Sections. I will in the <hi>firſt,</hi> diſcourſe of the true Notion of Humane Life. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> of the right Conduct or Regulation of the two different kinds of Life, Active and Contemplative.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Life a great Bleſſing in it ſelf. Proves a great Evil to ſome. And why? Happineſs perfect only in Heaven.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THô Life render us capable of Pain as well as Pleaſure, yet has it ever been valued as the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſing, the Love of it is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and the ſtrongeſt Principle in us, it moves the Infant before he knows how to rate the Pleaſures of Life, or can apprehend any Evil in Death; it grows up to ſtrength and maturity in Man, and is the Soveraign Paſſion in him, to which all the reſt pay homage; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man has will he give for his Life:</hi> Age does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little diminiſh it, and Miſery it ſelf cannot extinguiſh it. Nor does this Paſſion want the ſuffrage of the wiſeſt and the greateſt men, or the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39250:7"/>
of God; for one chief deſign of Society and Government, of Laws and Arms, is the protection of Life; and God, who beſt underſtood the bent of Humane Nature, has propoſed as the biggeſt Bleſſing and powerfulleſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Obedience, a long Life (I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine not now what it farther prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) under the Old Teſtament, and an eternal one under the New. And for all this there is plain reaſon, for Life, if it be not, when rightly underſtood, Happineſs it ſelf, yet is it ſurely the Foundation of it, and the Foundation in a Building, if it be not as beautiful as upper Stories, yet is it ever as neceſſary. I wonder not therefore that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death ſhook the Piety of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and the Courage of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo that the one <hi>wept ſore,</hi> and the other <hi>fell to the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to all this will it not be objected? Alas! How many are there, who all their days are no more ſenſible of the good of Life, than of the Pleaſures and Repaſts of a Dream, who being come to Threeſcore years and ten, that is to dye, do not yet underſtand what it is to live; ah! how many? which is yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39250:7"/>
worſe, to whom Life is a burden, and yet Death a terror; who when they are to give back the Breath of Life, have juſt reaſon to wiſh they had never received it; and to curſe the day that they were born. And do not <hi>Elijah, Job, Solomon, Jeremy, Eſdras,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, great and good men, talk of Life at a different rate from what I here do, and repreſent it to us under another Notion, and quite contrary Character? <hi>Better is the day of death than the day of ones birth. Let the day periſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was born, and the night wherein it was ſaid there is a man-child conceived.</hi> The Reflection of <hi>Eſdras</hi> on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery of Mankind, has as much weight and ſenſe, as <hi>Job</hi>'s on his own, has paſſion; <hi>For what profit is it for men now in this preſent time to live in heavineſs, and after death to look for puniſhment?</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we meet with every where, which ſeem to give us no very taking Idea of Life. To all this I anſwer, 'Tis with Life as with all other Bleſſings, the right uſe of it is our happineſs; the abuſe of it our miſery. There is nothing in the nature of the thing that implies evil or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39250:8"/>
trouble: nor has it any neceſſary and inevitable tendency to it. We muſt not therefore eſtimate a Bleſſing by the miſchief it occaſions ſuch as pervert and abuſe it; nor by the Complaints which Humane Frailty ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from wiſe and good men in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fit, or finally by the Reflections they ſometimes make, not on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick worth, or natural tendency of Life, but on the Evils which flow from the Corruption or Deprivation of it. 'Tis true, when all is ſaid, Heaven is the proper Region of Happineſs; there it dwells in its glory and majeſty, in all its fulneſs and excellence; but what then, becauſe Perfection does properly belong to Heaven, is there no Vertue upon Earth? becauſe all things are in their maturity and conſummation there, ſhall we deny that there is any ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or beauty here: Juſt ſo muſt we think of the happineſs of this, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that of another world; it is here in its Infancy, we do ſlumber, and are ſcarcely ever fully awake; we ſee little, penetrate and comprehend leſs; and we move very feebly and unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but all this while we grow up to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39250:8"/>
ſtrength, we advance towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Joynts grow firmer, our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture increaſes, our Underſtanding dawns towards day, and our Affections are gradually animated with a more generous and laſting heat; ſo that all this while this infant ſtate of Happineſs is pleaſant and promiſing, and every ſtep in the whole progreſs towards Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, preſents us with freſh Beauties and Delights; but I know no body ſo fantaſtick, as to deſpiſe the preſent Life becauſe it is not equal to that above; and he that thinks there is none above, ſets the more value on this, becauſe he has nothing more or further to expect. I will not therefore ſpend any more time in endeavouring to prove Life a valuable Bleſſing, but rather proceed to ſhow how every man may really make it ſuch to himſelf, which I think I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more compendiouſly do, than by ſtating the true Notion of Humane Life; for as our Miſery flows from the abuſe, and our Happineſs from the right uſe of Life, ſo does the abuſe from falſe, and the right uſe from true Notions of it.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Life, what in a natural ſenſe. What in a moral. Life, Perfection, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, inſeparably united. More particularly, Life conſiſts not in Sloth, Senſuality, Worldlineſs, Deviliſhneſs, but in the Regulation of all our Actions according to right Reaſon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LIFE may be conſidered either in a Natural or Moral Senſe; in the former acceptation, what it is, is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry very abſtruſe and intricate, like the Egyptian <hi>Nile,</hi> thô its Streams be viſible to every Eye, its Source or Fountain is concealed; or like Grace, thô we feel its Energy, and taſte its Fruits, yet we cannot diſcover, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine its Eſſence; but to carry our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thus far, is accuracy enough in Moral Diſcourſes, whoſe end is not Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Life then, whatever it be in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Eſſence, as far as we can diſcern it, is nothing elſe but that force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which moves and acts the Man; and to live, ſpeaking in a natural ſenſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39250:9"/>
is to exert the Powers and Faculties of Nature; according to which account of Life, 'tis capable of as many Notions as are the different Offices it performs; 'tis Senſe and Motion in the Body, 'tis Perception and Fancy in the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis Knowledge in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Love and Hate, with all their Train or Retinue of Paſſions in the Heart or Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe all Morality conſiſts in the right uſe of thoſe Bleſſings which our great and bountiful Author confers upon us, therefore in a moral ſenſe, the true Life of Man is nothing elſe, but the right uſe of our whole Nature, an active imploying it in its due Functions and Offices, a vigorous Exerciſe of all our Powers and Faculties, in a manner ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Dignity and Deſign, to the Frame and Conſtitution of our Beings: To live then in a moral ſenſe, is to know and contemplate, to love and purſue that which is the true Good of Man, this is the Life of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will, Affections, and of the whole Man; and whatever acts of ours are not ſome way or other converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Truth and Goodneſs, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39250:10"/>
Acts of Humane Life, but Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot chuſe but pauſe a little, to admire and magnifie the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Architect, who has contrived an inſeparable Connection and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dependance between Life, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Fruition, every rational Act, every right Uſe or Exertion of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers and Faculties, as it is of the Eſſence of Moral Life; ſo does it contribute to the Improvement and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Beings, and to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Felicity of our ſtate; for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is the Reſult of ſuch repeated Acts and Pleaſure of our entertaining our ſelves with proper and agreeable Objects. Happy man! to whom, to live, improve, and enjoy is the ſame thing; who cannot defeat God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his own Happineſs, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting his Nature, and depraving his Faculties, but by making an ill uſe, or none at all, of the Favours and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God.</p>
                  <p>If we examine this Notion of Life more cloſely, and diſtinctly, and reſolve this general Account of it, into ſeveral
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39250:10"/>
Particulars, we ſhall eaſily arrive at a fuller and clearer Comprehenſion of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis evident from this Account of Life, that it does not conſiſt in <hi>Sloth,</hi> in the meer marriage or cohabitation of Soul and Body; in meer Duration or Continuance in this World. <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed, out of a natural Abhorrence of Death, tells us, <hi>Truly Light is ſweet and a pleaſant thing it is to behold the Sun,</hi> Eccl. 2.7. Something it is, if we muſt call it pleaſure, 'tis but a faint and low one, ſuch as all the Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but Bats, and Owls, and Moles are capable of, but, according to my Philoſophy, it can never deſerve the Name of Life: He that poſſeſſes Vital Powers and Faculties, is in a Capacity of Life, but he only that exerts them Lives. To live is not to ſpend or waſt our time, but to imploy it: 'Tis a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Hiſtory of Life, when it can all be ſummed up in the few Syllables of a Funeral Ring; he lived to, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it is wont to be expreſſed, he died ſuch a day of the Month, ſuch a year of his Age; for indeed he lived not at all; Life is a meer Dream, not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39250:11"/>
only on the account of its ſhortneſs, but alſo of its Night and Lethargy, when ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Ignorance confines and dims the Proſpect, and Sluggiſhneſs enfeebles all the powers of the Mind, Vigour and Activity, Fruition and Enjoyment, make up Life; without theſe Life is but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Embryo, a mingled twilight that never will be Day; the Images, the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful form of things are faint and obſcure, like Pictures drawn in watery Colours, and weak and imperfect ſtroaks, and vaniſh as eaſie as thoſe half Sounds and imperfect Forms which we take in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſleep and waking; all their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions move drowſily and heavily, and all their Entertainments have no more reliſh than abortive Fruit, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ripened into Sweetneſs or Beauty. When I have obſerved any one thus waſting away a whole Life, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being once well awake in it, paſſing through the World like a heedleſs Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, without making any Reflections or Obſervations, without any Deſign or Purpoſe beſeeming a Man; ah! thought I, is this that Creature for which this great Theater the World was made? for which it was ſo adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39250:11"/>
and ſo enriched? Is this the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is the Epitome of the World? the top and glory of the viſible Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a little inferiour to Angels, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to God; Is this Machine acted by a moving Flame, and by a wiſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit? Ah! how much is this poor uſeleſs ſtupid thing ſunk beneath the Dignity and Deſign of its Nature? How far ſhort is it faln of the Glory to which God had deſtined it? Shall this contemplative thing ever be admitted to Eternal Life, who has ſo wretchedly fooled away this Temporal one? Or can Crowns and Kingdoms be reſerved for one who has been ſo ill a Steward of all theſe Talents God has committed to him? No ſurely, I could upon the firſt thought imagine his ſluggiſh Soul would vaniſh like thoſe of Brutes, or as the Stoicks fancy, thoſe of Fools; I could eaſily imagine that it could ſleep, not as ſome fancy all Souls do to the Reſurrection, but to all Eternity. But upon better conſideration, I find this ignorant and incogitant Life, is not ſo innocent as to deſerve no worſe a Fate; For is it a ſmall Crime to live barren and unfruitful, endowed with ſo many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39250:12"/>
Talents? to fruſtrate the deſign of our Creation, to choak and ſtifle all the Seeds of a Divine Life, and Perfection, to quench the Grace and Spirit of God. In a word, is it a ſmall Crime to be falſe and perfidious to God, unjuſt and injurious to Man? No, it cannot be; and therefore in the parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, wherein the laſt Audit or Day of Accompts is repreſented, the ſlothful and wicked Servant ſignifie one and the ſame thing, and muſt undergo one and the ſame Sentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Life</hi> cannot conſiſt in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, that is, in the meer careſſing our Senſes, or the gratification of our Carnal Appetites. The Reaſons of this Aſſertion are evident from the general Notion of Life. For firſt, This is not the Exerciſe of the whole Nature, but a part of it, and that the inferiour and ignobler too. Secondly, It is not an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment ſuitable to the Dignity of our Nature.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Senſuality imploys only the meaner part of us; St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward and the inward man, and ſeems to make up the whole man of Spirit, Soul, and Body; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39250:12"/>
ſome both Divines and Philoſophers of no ſmall note, both Modern and Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, have taught that there are two diſtinct Souls in man, a Senſitive and a Rational one; if this be ſo, the Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt, thô he ſeem fond of Life, does fooliſhly contemn the better half of it; and as much a Slave to Pleaſure as he is, he chuſes to drink only the Dregs, and lets the pure Streams of ſprightly and delicious Life paſs by untaſted; for if there be a Senſitive and Rational Soul, there muſt be a Senſitive and a Rational Life too, diſtinct and different from one another, and one as much elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the other, as are the Principles they flow from. But whether this be ſo or no, does not import much; for it is plain that Life, whatever it be, is like Seed, which according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Soyl it is ſown in, produces Fruit more or leſs rich and ſucculent, more or leſs luſcious and beautiful; here it ſprouts forth like the ſeven poor and lean, there like the ſeven plump and rich Ears of Corn in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream; and ſhould it by way of fiction be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that one and the ſame Soul did communicate Life to Men, Beaſts, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39250:13"/>
Vegetables; however, Life in each would be equal in the dignity of its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, it would vaſtly differ in its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Operations; ſo whether Life in Man flow from one or two diſtinct Principles, it is evident that its Price and Dignity varies according to the different Powers and Faculties which it moves and animates, and by conſequence that Life which diſplays it ſelf in the acts of our Rational Part, will be as different from that which conſiſts in Senſation, and the Motions of Bodily Appetites, as is the Light that glitters in a Diamond from that which faintly imitates it in a Pebble; the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and the more exquiſite our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the vaſter is the Empire of Life, and the more delicate and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all its Functions and Operations: How evident is this in all the Organs and Senſes of the Body? Let Darkneſs invade the Eye, and Deafneſs the Ear, and then within what narrow and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bounds is the bodily Life reduced? How few and ignoble are the Vital Acts and Operations of the Body? How vile and contemptible are all the Fruits or Inſtances of a ſenſitive Life? If then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39250:13"/>
there be no Senſe or Organ of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuperfluous, can we think the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul it ſelf can be ſo? If there be no Power, no Capacity of a ſenſitive Soul, by which Life is not enlarged or enriched, muſt we not needs conclude, That to extinguiſh the Immortal Spirit within us, and as it were, to diſcard all its Powers and Faculties, muſt needs be to impoveriſh, mutilate, and ſtifle it; ſince I have a Soul as well as Body, ſince the one is as capable of converſing with God and Heaven, with Truth and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs and Perfection, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of converſing with this World of viſible Objects, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That to be deſtitute of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Faith, of Hope and Love, is more injurious to the true Life of Man, than to be Deaf or Blind; that Stupidity or Lethargy in the Soul, ſuch as renders it altogether incapable of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Pleaſure, is as inconſiſtent with the true Life of Man, as Lethargy or a dead Palſie in the Body can be; and to be excluded from Commerce with the inviſible World, is as fatal to it, as to be debarred the viſible one. From all this 'tis evident, that whether we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39250:14"/>
conſider Life with reſpect to its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and Dignity, or to its Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Extenſion, Senſuality is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly injurious to it in both reſpects, ſo far doth it debaſe and contract it, that I may boldly conclude, to place Life in Senſuality, is to renounce the much more valuable and delightful part of it, to baniſh our ſelves the much better World, and to rob our ſelves of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Joys and Pleaſures which we might reap from the rational Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that is, the nobleſt Capacities and Endowments of our Nature. Thô this be abundantly enough to evince, that Life conſiſts not in Senſuality, yet this being of the higheſt Importance to Humane Happineſs, I will proceed to the ſecond Argument againſt it, that is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not conſonant to the Dignity of Humane Nature, or which is all one, to the Deſign of our Beings, conſpicuous in our Frame and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who, that ever conſidered what Senſuality was, how narrow the extent of Senſe, how mean and brutiſh the Pleaſure that terminates in it; what a Corruption and Degeneracy it ends in;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39250:14"/>
Who? I ſay, that has ever conſidered theſe, and a thouſand things more, can believe that Senſuality is an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy of Man? Is this the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a vaſt and comprehenſive mind? Is this conſiſtent with ambitious Deſires of Immortality, with unquenchable Thirſt of Truth, with a Capacity of diſcovering Spiritual Excellencies and Moral Beauties and Perfections? Was it for this we were endowed with Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to worſhip and adore a Deity? What can be as much as fancied the uſe of Wiſdom, Magnanimity, Conſcience, Sagacity, Caution, Fear, Foreſight and anxious Enquiries into future Things and Times, if Senſuality had been the only Employment deſigned Man; how much more fit had we been formed for this end, if there had been in us no Reaſon to check and controul us, no Conſcience that could fill us with regret for the paſt, or fear for the Future; no Wiſdom that could teach us that there were any thing above us, nor greatneſs of mind that could reproach us for ſtooping to any thing below us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis almoſt ſuperfluous here to add, That Life conſiſts not in <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi>

or <hi>Deviliſhneſs;</hi> as to the former of theſe, by which I mean the Cares and Purſuits of the World, 'tis plain, that to employ our Time or Faculties in this alone, is not to Live, but at beſt to provide for Life: Neceſſity may ſometimes ſubject us to the drudgery and ſlavery of the World, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Choice never ſhould. I know no other difference between a mean For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and a great one, than this, that the great one ſets a Man above thoſe Cares and Toils, which the mean one forces him to ſubmit to; that the one puts the fortunate Man into the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſſeſſion of all the Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Life, Improvement and Fruition, and of Leaſure and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make uſe of them; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obliges the leſs fortunate Man to purchaſe theſe Advantages with Toil and Sweat, Sollicitude and Care; 'tis therefore an unpardonable wilfulneſs or blindneſs, whenever that Vaſſalage, which is the Infelicity of the mean Man, is the choice of the rich and fortunate one: Nor is it a more pardonable Error in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who continue the drudgey and care when the neceſſity is over, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39250:15"/>
ſuffer all the diſadvantages of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fortune, even when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a plentiful one, who never think it time to begin to Live, or to enjoy the Succeſs of their Cares and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, this is an Abſurdity as groſs as his, who after he has plowed and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould refuſe to reap; or his, who having, with much coſt and labour, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out a plentiful Table, ſhould not at length find in his heart to fall too and eat.</p>
                  <p>Life then conſiſts not in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things which a man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, much leſs in the vexation or toil of acquiring, ſecuring, or increaſing them, which is that I intend by <hi>Worldlineſs;</hi> but leaſt of all can Life conſiſt in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſhneſs,</hi> that is, Wrath, Strife, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Pride, and ſuch like; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called the Vigour and Activity, but Storm and Agony of our Nature; this is a ſtate wherein the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is covered with a Darkneſs of Hell, that is, Ignorance of Good and Evil; and the Paſſions are but Furies unchain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and let looſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Having thus, by reſolving particularly concerning Life, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts

not either in Sloth or Senſuality, <hi>Worldlineſs</hi> or <hi>Deviliſhneſs,</hi> pointed out thoſe fatal Errours which miſlead and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Men from the Paths of Peace and Happineſs; 'tis now time to ſhew in the laſt place, what it is, wherein Life does more immediately and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt, that is, in a vigorous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Employment of the whole Man, according to the Rules and Dictates of right Reaſon: When I make Reaſon the Director and Guide of Humane Life, when I conſtitute it Dictator over all the Powers and Paſſions of Man, I do no more mean to exclude the Aid of Revelation, and the Spirit of God, than when I affirm the Eye to be the Guide of the Body, I intend to deny the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Light to good Eyes, or of Spectacles and Collyriums to dim or diſturbed ones: The Propoſition thus guarded, will appear indiſputable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who ſhall conſider the frame and make of Man, that we are rational Creatures, is a Truth never hitherto controverted; and that Reaſon is the Soveraign Faculty in us, appears from the Univerſal Appeal of all Sides and all Sects to its Tribunal. Not the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39250:16"/>
and wiſe only, but the looſe and the vicious plead the Authority of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in defence of their Choice and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and in all the numberleſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes that are in the World, thô only one ſide can have the warrant and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Reaſon, yet all do pretend to it; ſo that thô there be no Power or Authority which in reality be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently oppoſed and violated, there is alſo none which is more unanimouſly owned, and univerſally acknowledged: As therefore it is plain, from what has been diſcourſed before, That Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in vital Powers and Faculties, but in the Exerciſe and Employment of them; ſo is it as plain, that in this we are not to follow the Conduct of Fancy and Imagination, of Luſt and Paſſion, but of Reaſon: This is the right uſe of our Natural Gifts, which diſtinguiſhes Man from Beaſts, and Men from one another; the Hero from the Caitiff and Villain, the Philoſopher from the Fool, and the Saint from the Sinner: In this conſiſts the Order and Dignity of Humane Nature, in this the Beauty and Tranquility of Humane Life; and in this the inward Joy and Peace of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39250:17"/>
Mind of Man. This will be yet more manifeſt to whoſoever will take the pains to enquire what the Office of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is; 'tis this which teaches us what rank we hold among the Creatures of God, what ſtation we fill in the World, what our Relations and Dependencies are, what the Duty and what the Hopes, what the Benefit and what the Pleaſure that reſult from each: 'Tis this which preſcribes all our Powers and Paſſions, their Order, Place, and Work; 'Tis this which diſtinguiſhes Truth and Falſhood, Good and Evil; 'Tis this which fills us with the Knowledge, and enflames us with the Love of our Soveraign Happineſs, and Judges of the Means and Ways that lead to it; and finally, 'tis this which teaches us to ſet a true rate and value upon all inferiour things, in proportion to their tendency, either to promote or obſtruct our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good: Happy therefore is that Life where Reaſon is the Soveraign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator of all our Actions, and where the Imagination and Paſſions, all the Powers of the Soul, are yet Servants and Inſtruments of Reaſon: Happy this Life, for it can neither want Pleaſure

to entertain it, nor Buſineſs to imploy it; happy the Soul which thus lives, for it ſhall never want Comfort to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, Hopes to encourage it, nor Crowns to reward it; for as it grows in Wiſdom and Goodneſs, ſo muſt it in Favour with God and Man; and its Peace and Tranquility, its Joys and Expectations muſt receive a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Increaſe too.</p>

Reaſon, for this, as you have ſeen, is to be the Guide and Superintendent of all our Powers and Faculties, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter and Judge of all our Actions; <hi>If the light that is in you be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs,</hi> Matth. 6.23. Vigour and Activity, if Reaſon do not ſteer them, will but prove miſchievous and fatal to us; Diligence and Induſtry themſelves will only ſerve to corrupt our Nature, and embroyl our Life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very deviation from Reaſon is a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from our true Perfection and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; the Fool and the Sinner do in the Language of the Scripture ſignifie the ſame thing, and ſo do Sin and Miſery. This is the true Original of all thoſe Miſchiefs which infeſt the World, the neglect or contempt of right Reaſon; 'Tis this which makes our Complaints ſo numerous, and ſo bitter; 'Tis this that makes us ſo weak and ſoft in Adverſity, ſo reſtleſs and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfied even in Proſperity it ſelf; 'Tis this creates all thoſe Diſaſters and Diſappointments which make us often quarrel at Providence, and curſe our Fortune; <hi>The folly of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against

Well therefore did the Wiſeman adviſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſdom, and withal thy getting, get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> The Neceſſity of this does eaſily appear from the ſlighteſt Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Work or Office of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of which I have given a brief and general Account before, much more from the uſe of it, in three great Points; The Employing our Faculties, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Good, and the Bearing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Employing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Soul of Man like a fertile Field, ſeems alike apt to produce either Herbs or Weeds; the Faculties of it are capable of being the Inſtruments of the greateſt Evil or the greateſt Good; the greateſt Good, if regulated and conducted by Reaſon; the greateſt Evil, if blindly and raſhly led by any other Principle. What is the Imagination of a Fool, but a Shop of Toys and Trinkets, not the Labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of a Philoſopher, where a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vain trifling and empty Ideas flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſedly up and down? What his Memory, but a Receptacle and Sink of Sins and Follies, of mean and ſhameful
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39250:19"/>
Things and Actions, not a Treaſury of excellent Truths, laid up like Amuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Proviſion for time both of Peace and War? What his Heart, but the Rendevouz of a thouſand mutinous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and diſhonourable Luſts which rend and tear him, worſe than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the Goſpel the Man poſſeſſed? Nay, what is even Fancy and Wit it ſelf, if deſtitute of ſound Judgment and true Reaſon, but I know not what ſort of flaſhes, which dazle but do not guide, ſerve for amuzement rather than nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment or delight, and therefore the Author is very well paid, if he be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtarved, which is generally his Fate. In a word, neither Buſineſs nor Diverſion can have in them any thing truly uſeful or truly pleaſing, if they be not regulated and conducted by right Reaſon, and all the Diſpoſitions and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Nature will be, but either loſt upon Fooleries, or abuſed to our Ruin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The uſe of Reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the fruition of Good. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is like Light ſhed upon the Face of the World, which diſcovers all its various Beauties and wondrous Wealth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39250:19"/>
which while Darkneſs covered them, were as thô they had not been; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon we ſhall not be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern nor value our own Happineſs, nor be ſenſible of our Bleſſings and Goods, even thô they croud and throng upon us; without this our very Enjoyments will prove fatal to our Repoſe, and we ſhall meet Gall and Wormwood in the bottom of our Draughts of Pleaſure: <hi>For the turning away of the Simple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of Fools ſhall destroy them,</hi> Prov. 1.32. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no ſmall Philoſophy, either to render Buſineſs pleaſant, or Pleaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, either to diſcharge thoſe Duties which a great Birth or eminent Station call men to, or to employ that time which an ample Fortune makes them entirely Maſters of. And to husband a Life of Eaſe and Enjoyment to the beſt, and fill it with Vertue and Honour; ah! how often have I ſeen the vigour of Nature diſſolved by Pleaſure, the edge and fineneſs of its parts matted and blunted by ſloth and ſoftneſs? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I ſeen men rendered mean and contemptible by Succeſs and Proſperity, for which they were not big enough,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39250:20"/>
whereas had the Mind been well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and enriched with true Wiſdom, Pleaſure and Diverſion themſelves had refined and recruited Nature, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Honour, and Plenty, had only placed worth and greatneſs in a better Light; this is true in its proportion from the loweſt to the higheſt ſtation; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſenſe and reaſon to govern and enjoy Proſperity; an obſcure and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fortune is moſt convenient both to conceal and preſerve a Fool; for Plenty and Power, Dignity and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do but expoſe him to ſcorn and danger, and it were well if the poor Creature could periſh or ſuffer alone; but the miſchief is, like a falſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Foundation, overthrows the Deſigns and Intereſts that are built upon him, and miſerably betrays the confidences repoſed in him: But how great ſoever the uſe of Reaſon be as to the Goods, it is no leſs in relation to the Evils of this World; for,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Reaſon is the Pilot of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and ſteers it ſteddily through wild and tempeſtuous Seas, amidſt the Rocks and Shelves of Luſt and Fancy, Fortune and Folly, Ignorance, Errour,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39250:20"/>
and a thouſand Cheats and Impoſtures: 'Tis this alone that enables Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe imaginary Evils, and vanquiſh real ones; it arms the mind with true and laſting Magnanimity, furniſhes it with ſolid Comforts, and teaches it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Life and Health, Vertue and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, out of the madneſs and mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men and Fortune, like Antidotes and Cordials out of things poiſonous and baneful in themſelves: It is not now to be wondered at, after this Account, how imperfect ſoever it be, of the uſe of Reaſon (which ſufficiently ſhews how eſſential it is to the Being, the Ornament and Felicity of Humane Life) if I have reſolved it to be the great Buſineſs of Man to improve and cultivate it, ſurely all the great Men of the World, and all the inſpired Ones, have been of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for their chief, if not only Deſign, ever was, either to obtain Wiſdom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or propagate it amongſt others; and 'tis evident that God himſelf has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried on this one Deſign of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Wiſdom amongſt the Sons of Men; this is the preheminence of his Laws above thoſe of Men, that theſe reſtrain the Actions, but thoſe enlighten
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39250:21"/>
the Mind; theſe puniſh Offences and Crimes, but thoſe by informing the Judgment, and ſtrengthning the Reaſon of Man, prevent the commiſſion of them, and direct and inſtigate him to the practiſe of Vertue. This then is the great Work that God and Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to, that we ſhould make daily progreſs and proficiency in Knowledge and Underſtanding, <hi>That we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our ears to Wiſdom, and apply our hearts to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that we ſhall ſeek her as Silver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſures:</hi> And this is that which our Nature and State invite us too, for our Perfection and our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, our Succeſs and our Security, our Repoſe and Tranquility, and in one word, our true Happineſs depend upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It eaſily follows from the right Notion of Life, that we are to bid open Defiance to all thoſe things which directly oppoſe, or ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Authority of Reaſon, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way obſtruct the free exerciſe of its Power and Sovereignty; for 'tis to no purpoſe to travail and labour to advance Reaſon, if afterwards we refuſe to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39250:21"/>
governed and conducted by it, Reaſon, if we do not live by it, will ſerve only to increaſe our ſhame and guilt: St. <hi>Peter</hi> thinks <hi>it better never to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than after the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it to turn from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments delivered unto us,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.21. To ſtifle the Sparks of Reaſon by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ſloth, to choak the Seeds of Wiſdom and Perfection by a lazy or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious education, is a great Crime; but to deſert and betray our Reaſon, grown up to ſome maturity, to hold it in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and fetters, to defile and proſtitute it, by compelling it to ſerve and flatter abominable Paſſions; this ſure muſt be a far greater degree of wickedneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and conſequently muſt needs expoſe the Man to the ſcorn or pity of the wiſe and rational part of Mankind, to the reproaches and confuſion of his own Conſcience, and to the wrath and indignation of God; or if none of theſe Miſchiefs ſhould attend the contempt and profanation of Knowledge, yet there is one more of it ſelf ſufficient to make Man miſerable, it precipitates him into all the irregularities and wildneſſes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, nothing being ſo inſolent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39250:22"/>
ſo ſavage and untamable as thoſe Paſſions which are accuſtomed to over-power and maſter Reaſon, 'tis from all this manifeſt, That whoever loves Life, and would experience it a real Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, muſt with all his power ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to remove and defeat, whatever may hinder his ready and entire Submiſſion to the Dictates of Reaſon. Now the things which enfeeble the ſtrength of our Reaſon, and baffle its Authority, are ſuch as theſe, Fancy, Paſſion, Example, Cuſtom, theſe we muſt ever Combat, till we have reduced them within their Bounds: Fancy ſurprizes, Paſſion over-powers, Cuſtom and Example betray our Reaſon; we muſt therefore always oppoſe the giddineſs of Fancy, and the violence of Paſſion, and guard our Minds againſt the inſinuation of Cuſtom and Example; and to do this well, to do it ſucceſsfully, is of greater importance than any work of our Secular Calling, than any attendance upon Trade, or a Temporal Intereſt; this can only make us great, but that can make us wiſe; this can make us rich, but that will make us happy; this therefore muſt be the next great Buſineſs of Life, to aſſert the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39250:22"/>
and Soveraignty of Reaſon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer it to be held captive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled by any vitious Principle, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Luſt: Happy the Man who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in this! his Sincerity ſhall be to him as good as Infallibility; his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall never reproach him, nor God condemn him; and thô he may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hit the next way, he ſhall never wholly miſs the right way to <hi>Happineſs,</hi> therefore from this Notion of Life,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may infer the poſſibility of <hi>Humane Happineſs</hi> in every ſtate; for ſince to Live is but to act regularly, to uſe and employ our Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties rationally; and ſince Life, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Fruition are one and the ſame thing, or elſe inſeparably and intimately united, it is evident that no Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can deſtroy our Happineſs, unleſs they deſtroy our Reaſon; no Condition can render us miſerable, but that which can render it impoſſible for us to act rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which obſtructs our attainment of knowledge, or our liberty of acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to it. But what Circumſtances can theſe be? what Condition can we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? wherein it ſhall be impoſſible for a Chriſtian to know his Soveraign Good,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39250:23"/>
and purſue it, to learn his Duty, and to practiſe it; wherein it ſhall be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to ſearch and contemplate Truth, to love and follow after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Goodneſs, and to be meek and humble, modeſt and magnanimous, juſt and charitable, pure and devout; wherein, in one word, it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to live by Faith, or which is the ſame thing in my ſenſe, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Solomon</hi> long ſince obſerved, <hi>That Wiſdom uttered her voice in the Streets, and in the meetings of the High-ways.</hi> This is more eminently true now, ſince the Reaſon of Mankind has been refined and defaecated by Revelation, and true Philoſophy has been diffuſed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed through the World; the Fountains of Truth and Wiſdom lie open to all who thirſt after them, and God no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any his Grace, than his Revelation. All which being ſo, 'tis evident that as God has put it in the power of every Man to act rationally, ſo has he put it in every Man's power to be happy; that <hi>Humane Happineſs</hi> is not precarious or dependant on Fortune, but our ſelves; for Life conſiſts not in the abundance of things which a Man poſſeſſes, but in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39250:23"/>
right uſe of them; <hi>and better is a poor and wiſe Child, than an old and fooliſh King,</hi> Eccl. 4.13. For the good eſtate of the Mind conſiſts not in foreign but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Poſſeſſions, not in the riches of Fortune, but of Grace and Vertue; and Fruition cannot conſiſt, either in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Temporal Things, or the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Nature, but in the true Cultivation and Improvement of the one, and the right uſe of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From hence, Laſtly, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appears on what account length of days is a great Bleſſing, whether conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or with reſpect to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Life. Firſt in its ſelf; If Life did conſiſt in earthineſs, that is, the ſcraping and raking together ſums of Money, 'tis plain that Life muſt ebb and flow with our Fortune, and when ever the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Times or Trades ſhould put a ſtop to the career of our Succeſs, and give a check to all our further Hopes and Projects, we ſhould have nothing elſe to do but to break off the Thred of Life; for what uſe could we make of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of our miſerable Days! Or if Life did conſiſt in Senſuality, we ſhould have little reaſon to deſire to ſurvive our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39250:24"/>
youth and ſtrength, and length of days would be rather a Burden than a Bleſſing, for we ſhould ſoon out-live our Pleaſures, and ſhrink and wither into dull, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and contemptible things. But if my Notion of Life be true, the Pleaſures and Joys of it muſt increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with our Years, ſince Reaſon ought day by day to advance to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Maturity, and more abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: <hi>With the Ancient is wiſdom, and in length of days underſtanding,</hi> Job 12.12. <hi>And the paths of the Righteous are like the ſhining light that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> A thorough Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the emptineſs and uncertainty of this World with a longer and more intimate acquaintance with another, ſhould poſſeſs the Soul of this Man with a magnanimity that nothing could ſhake, with a tranquility that nothing could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb: The Cuſtom of doing good, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Peace and Delight that ſpring from the Reflections on it, ſhould make the current of his Actions run ſmooth and calm; his Obſervations on the Changes and Turns of Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Riſe and Declenſion of Parties and Cauſes, the ſecret Springs and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39250:24"/>
Wheels of the Paſſions of the Mind of Man, together with all the various Arts of managing them, do fill him with a ſort of a Divine fore-knowledge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him with a wondrous proſpect, and how happy muſt this Man be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? and how much honoured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by others, conſulted as an Oracle, propoſed as an Original of Goodneſs, the abſolute Maſter of this World, and the immediate Heir of another. For which is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is the only Notion of Life which can render it a Bleſſing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its influence upon another; none but Rational Pleaſures, which are the Antepaſt of Heaven, can enkindle our Thirſt, or qualifie us for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe above; nothing but the wiſe and rational Employments of our Faculties can prepare us for a Heaven, or entitle us to it. Nay further, if Life had not this influence upon another World, length of days would be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, not Advantage to us; it would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep us from our Heaven, delay and put off our Happineſs; but now, when according to this Notion of Life, every act of Life does perfect our Nature, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39250:25"/>
our Capacity, and increaſe our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of Glory, when every day that is added to Life by the production of ſome new fruit, does add new Stars to our Crowns of Righteouſneſs, and new Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to our heavenly Inheritance: It is evident that a long Life is a great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, not only on its own account, but alſo of that Life which we expect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Bleſſed God! how conſpicuous is thy Goodneſs in this whole contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? how cloſely and inſeparably haſt thou united Vertue and Happineſs? and how natural is the aſſent from a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life here, to a glorious Life hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>

                     <p>The Conveniences and the Inconveniences of the Active and Contemplative Life. The Active more neceſſary. The ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grounds on which men determine their Choice, that is, Intereſt, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Inclination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Felicity or Infelicity of Man depending not a little upon the choice he makes of his Courſe of Life, it is worth the conſidering which of theſe two Kinds, the Active or Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, is to be preferred. If they be compared in themſelves, the Active ſeems to have more in it of Glory, but alſo more of hazard; it ſeems more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others, but not ſo eaſie to a Man's ſelf: He therefore that would render each ſtate perfect, and remove the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39250:26"/>
of each, muſt ſtudy how to relieve the toil, and obviate the hazard of the Active, and to prevent the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs and ingloriouſneſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Life.</p>
                  <p>But which ſoever of theſe two be the more excellent in it ſelf, 'tis certain the Active Life is the more neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible to the well-being of Humane Society. Such is the Nature of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that being liable to various Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, it requires the various Relief of manifold Aſſiſtances, to which every Man is bound to contribute his ſhare: We have Minds that muſt be cultivated, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that muſt be provided for. The ſtate either of War or Peace, hath its ſeveral wants, all which call for ſeveral Arts to wage the one, and enrich and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the other; without theſe we ſhould find no Defence in War, nor Pleaſure in Peace; without theſe Humane Life would grow wild and ſavage, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature would be uncultivated and unſociable; without theſe our Houſes had ſtill been Caves and Grots, our Food A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns and Water, our Clothing the Spoils of Beaſts, and the ſpeculative Man would ſoon ſuffer thoſe Neceſſities which would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39250:27"/>
convince him that he lived in a World, and in a Body, which required more at his hands than meer muſing and thinking, and would ſoon force him to give over his Speculations for the more neceſſary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of Food and Raiment: And if he could be content with that Proviſion which Nature, unaided by Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, would yield him and the Beaſts of the Field, yet would he not be able to promiſe himſelf the continuance of this mighty Bleſſing; without Laws and Arms, the undiſciplined Rabble would diſturb his Muſings, Avarice and Violence would invade his Walk, and drive him from his little Cottage and Brook where he had choſe his Retreat: For theſe, and a great many other Reaſons, the World hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled the Authors and Inventors of Laws and Arts amongſt their Gods, and has gratefully recorded the Memories of ſuch as have been the Benefactors of Mankind: And holy Writ it ſelf has not been wanting to do Honour to all ſuch, for it has regiſtred the Names of ſuch as have excell'd in any thing beneficial to the Publick.</p>
                  <p>But however this be, whatever be the Excellence and Advantage of an Active
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39250:27"/>
above a Contemplative Life, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf, or with reſpect to its ſerviceableneſs and uſefulneſs to the World, 'tis certain that Men generally ſpeaking, are not determined to the one or to the other, by theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by ſuch particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as often render that which is leſs excellent in it ſelf, more fit and proper for them; thus ſometimes Education trains Men up (ſhall I ſay,) or condemns them to a particular kind of Life, and the choice of others prevents the liberty of our own; ſometimes the ſolicitation of Friends carries us againſt the very bent and inclination of Nature, and ſometimes a lucky and unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence frees us from the trouble of perplexed Deliberation, and leads us on in methods which Humane Prudence could not have contrived; but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of all, we take counſel from the nature of our ſtate, and the neceſſities of our Fortune; how much is to be deferred to each of theſe, is a matter not eaſie to be decided; againſt Neceſſity we cannot diſpute, againſt the Invitations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence we ought not, if we have but good proofs of the one or the other: But
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39250:28"/>
'tis too too often that weakneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Courage makes us call that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which is not, and the flattery of our Hopes makes us interpret our Dreams or Fancies Divine Auguries or Preſages. As to Friends and Intereſt, I confeſs with the Ingenious Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> that an expert Man does more eaſily get up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saddle by the help of a Stirrop, than a much ſtronger by meer Force; yet it ought to be conſidered, that the Man who is unequal to the Deſigns of his Friends, renders their Patronage ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, but his own Life more. As to the bent or inclination of Nature, ſo mutable are the Tempers, or at leaſt the Fancies of Mankind, that this is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery not ſoon to be preſumed upon, or elſe I ſhould as ſoon adviſe to give up ones ſelf to this, as to any other Guide. The truth is, the trueſt Meaſures in this Enquiry are to be taken from a thorough knowledge of our ſelves, and of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Courſes of Life about which we deliberate; but alas! they are but few whom a propitious Providence has left at liberty to enter into this Deliberation, and fewer that are capable of forming a true Reſolution upon it: I am ſure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39250:28"/>
there is no Enquiry of Humane Life wherein there is more heed of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide, and therefore I would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel the young to conſult God in the firſt place, and next the moſt ſage and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced they can find out, for they ſtand in a place where many ways meet, and if they take the wrong, they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wander far, and it may be never recover the right. And as to others, who have ſtruggled long againſt Wind and Tide, who have floted long upon the Billows of Vulgar Errors of their own private Luſts and Fancies, they will be happy, I think, if after long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Folly, they make with all ſpeed for Land, and take the firſt Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour where they can ride in ſafety.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="subsection">
                     <p>BEfore I go about to ſet down thoſe Rules which may render Men of Rank and Fortune, belov'd, eminent, and happy in their ſtation, I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to convince ſuch of the Obligations they lye under to be ſome way or other uſeful and ſerviceable to the World; for 'tis in vain to talk of the Knowledge and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:39250:29"/>
Vertue neceſſary to ſupport and adorn a Civil Life; to ſuch as perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are born only to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own Humour and Fancy; and that it is the Prerogative of their Birth and Fortune to be idle, ignorant, and looſe.</p>
                     <p>Sect. 1. This then is the firſt thing I would fain make Gentlemen ſenſible of, that they cannot without impardonable Guilt and Reproach, waſte and fool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Life and Fortune; and I think this would not be very hard to effect, if they would pleaſe to make but a very ſlight Reflection upon the Arguments I here addreſs to them. You owe more to God, and to your Country, not to add to your ſelves, thô that be true too in a proper ſenſe, than any others do. To God— to his Providence you owe it, that you were born to thoſe Fortunes which others toil for; that you are the Maſters of that Time which others are forced to devote to their Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and that you are placed at firſt in thoſe advantageous heights which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers climb to by ſlow and tedious ſteps; your Guilt therefore is greater than the mean Man is capable of, while you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Honour of that God, from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39250:30"/>
whom alone you derive yours; while <hi>you</hi> dethrone <hi>Him</hi> who has raiſed <hi>you,</hi> and employ all your Power and Treaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Being from whom you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them; no Ingratitude, no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery or Baſeneſs like that of a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and Confident. And as you owe to God, ſo do you to your Country, more than other Men; you are they who ſhould be the Support and Ornament of it; you are placed in higher Orbs, not that like Meteors your ominous blaze ſhould be the gaze and terror of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but that like Stars you might lighten and beautifie, animate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the inferiour World, for you, like them, ſhould have an inlarged Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a ſwift and conſtant Motion, a bountiful and benign Influence: If your Vertues do not more diſtinguiſh you from the Crowd than your Fortunes, you are expoſed, not honoured, by the eminence of your Station, and you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch and betray your poor Country by your ſin and folly, which your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, your Wiſdom, your Courage, and your Bounty, with all thoſe other great Vertues which Perſons of your Rank ſhould ſhine with, ſhould protect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39250:30"/>
and enrich, and raiſe to the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Vertue and Power. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable muſt that Kingdom be, whoſe rich and great Ones are as much more impudently wicked, as they are more fortunate than other Men; when they, whoſe Example ſhould awe the Vitious, contribute not a little to corrupt the Vertuous part of it, and to debauch the very Genius and Spirit of the Nation: When they, who ſhould be Patriots of their Country, inſtead of being Men of Travel and Reading, of Abilities and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, of Honour and Activity, are verſed only in Eſſences and Perukes, Game-houſes and Stews, and have ſo far loſt the Qualities of a Gentleman, that they are meaner, falſer, and cowardlier than the loweſt of the People; thoſe muſt indeed be ſtrange Courts, Counſels, Parliaments, Armies which are filled and influenced by ſuch as theſe, that muſt be a wretched State where Men make their Court by Debauchery, and know no other Politicks than what an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Averſion to the National Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſtitution, or a more invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one to Religion and Vertue ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:39250:31"/>But if your Country move you not, conſider yet what you owe yourſelves: Idleneſs is both a Reproach and Burden; for what can be more diſhonourable, than to be good for nothing; or more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to an active Nature, ſuch as Man's is, than to have nothing to imploy it? What can be more ſhameful, than for a wealthy, or well-born Man, to be the pity or ſport of his Country, or the inward ſcorn even of his Domeſticks and Neighbours? And what can be a greater Plague, than for one who is Maſter of his whole Time, and of an ample For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, not to know how to imploy the one or the other, but in ſuch Courſes as tend to the diſgrace of his Family, the ruin of his Country, and the damnation of his Soul? <hi>You</hi> ought too, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that great Fortunes do generally mark Men out for great Troubles, as well as great Enjoyments; and were there no other Motive to a vigorous and active Life, but this one, that it did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Courage, and harden the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, this ſhould be ſufficient to any Man, who will but conſider to how many Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Revolutions, how many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters and Miſchiefs a great Fortune ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39250:31"/>
Men obnoxious, ſo that when Men had not yet entertained the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the unlawfulneſs of Self-murther, Poiſon, as appears from <hi>Livi</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi>'s Preſent to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, was a part of the Domeſtick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Families of the Great, and a Poiſon-bearer ſeems to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as natural an Office as a Cup-Bearer.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of all is, Gifts of Fortune, like thoſe of Grace or Nature, as they capacitate and qualifie, ſo do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and oblige Men to ſutable Duties, and Chriſtianity expects Increaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to Mens Talents. Not Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Luxury, not Ignorance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, but Knowledge and Vertue, and a more eminent degree of Service to God and Man, ought to be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctive Character of the Rich and Great, (for how ſhould that be the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of an illuſtrious Birth and ample Fortune, which is a Reproach and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Humane Nature?) Theſe are the Abilities that conſtitute Gentlemen truly great, that makes them the Props of a ſinking State, or the Stars and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a flouriſhing one; this is that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39250:32"/>
which the Safety and Glory of your Country, and your own Happineſs and Poſterity demand at your Hands; and happy were it if the Laws and Cuſtoms of our Country, as once thoſe of the beſt conſtituted Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, did exact Vertue and Induſtry with the greateſt rigour, and puniſhed Idleneſs and Riot with Infamy, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Death.</p>
                     <p>Nor has any one reaſon to complain, that to oblige the Gentleman to an active and induſtrious Life, is to debaſe his Quality, or to invade his Liberty, much leſs to rob him of all the Pleaſures and Advantages he is born to; on the quite contrary, an active Vertue is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Gentleman; this is the only ſolid Foundation the Love and Eſteem of his Country can be built on; all other Advantages of Fortune do but adorn him as a Pageant, to be the ſport and gaze of the Crowd, and all that have ſenſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſtinguiſh between Merit and Fortune, will inwardly deſpiſe the Fool and Sluggard, whatever Courtſhip and Complement they may make to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire and Landlord. And as Buſineſs can be no Diminution of his Honour, ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39250:32"/>
neither can it be of his Liberty; for not to inſiſt upon that great Truth, That the Service of Vertue is the only Freedom or Liberty of Man; not to mind you that the Buſineſs of Men of Wealth and Birth is always a matter of Choice not Neceſſity, they being ever in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to retire when they ſhall judge their Privacy and Leiſure more valuable than their Employments. This one ſingle Conſideration cannot but ſilence this Suggeſtion, That no Man is leſs Maſter of himſelf and Time, than the Man that has an ample Fortune and no Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for he is always expoſed to the forms and impertinences, to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and ſottiſhneſs of a number of People as idle and ignorant as himſelf; and I think there can be no Servitude ſo wretched, as that to Luxury and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor any Confinement or Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſo tedious as a complyance with the folly, with the trifling and looſneſs of the World; but Buſineſs is at all times a comely Excuſe, and never fails of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Man handſomly in poſſeſſion of his Liberty, and the diſpoſal of his own Time and Actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:39250:33"/>But of all the Aſperſions with which Addreſſes of this kind are wont to be aſſaulted, there is none more palpably injurious than this, That to condemn a Gentleman to Buſineſs, is to rob him of his Pleaſures; for the truth is, 'tis Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Imployment that gives guſt and reliſh to Pleaſure; 'tis this that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the Diſeaſe of Pleaſure, Surfeit and Satiety, and makes Diverſion always new, and Nature always vigorous; 'tis true indeed, a rational and manly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo raiſes and fortifies the Mind, that it is above being a Slave to Senſual Pleaſure, and ſo entertains it, that it needs not make vitious and ſinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures a Refuge againſt the dulneſs and nauſeouſneſs of Life: But after all, thô all this be true, there is one conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more important ſtill, which is, that the Buſineſs of a Gentleman, if diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it ought to be, is always attended with Pleaſure, and that a more brisk and ſenſible one than he can find in any thing elſe; for whether he Protects the Oppreſſed, or Oppoſes the Violent and the Unjuſt by his Power, whether he ſteers the Ignorant and the Simple to their Harbour, by his Wiſdom, or relieve
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39250:33"/>
the Neceſſity of the Poor by his Wealth? whether he ſupport a ſinking Friend, or raiſe a deſerving Creature? whether he aſſert the Authority of Laws, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rights of his Country? In a word, whether he aſſiſt the publick or the private by his Fortunes, his Abilities, or Vertues, all theſe Works have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them ſo great, ſo generous, that I cannot but think the Opportunities and Capacities of theſe the higheſt Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Prerogatives of a Fortunate Birth. It was the Sabbath, the Reſt of God, when he beheld all his Works, that they were exceeding good; nor can I believe God took more pleaſure in the Creation than he does in the Preſervation and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World: How pleaſing then muſt be the Reflections upon theſe God-like Works; for tho' this be not to create a new World, it is certainly to imbelliſh, govern, and ſupport the old. There is little reaſon to imagine why the Works of Vertue ſhould procure their Authors leſs pleaſure than thoſe of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Wit, and Learning do theirs. Why the Poet ſhould feel a bigger Joy riſe from a witty Poem, the Painter from a well finiſhed Piece, the Architect from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:39250:34"/>
a well contrived Building, the Scholar from a juſt and regular Diſcourſe, than a Gentleman ſhould from the happy and honourable Effects of Wiſdom, Courage, Bounty, and Magnanimity; theſe ſure are the greater Excellencies, and as the Original is more noble, ſo is the Iſſue too; for certainly to preſerve the Lives and Fortunes of Men, is much more than to make them ſeem to live in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; to raiſe a Family, is much more than to contrive and build a Houſe to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and actually diſperſe the Clouds and Sorrows of the Afflicted, by a preſent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous remedy, is much more than to treat the Fancy of the ſoft and vain; and in one word, actually to compoſe the Diviſions, allay the Heats, govern the Impetuoſities, and reſtrain the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Paſſions of Men by the force of Laws, by the influence of Example, and that Authority and Aſcendant which the Fortunes and Abilities of the great Ones give them over their Inferiours, is in my Judgment, a much more ſignal Service to God and Man, than it can ever be to debate a Controverſie with the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Judgment, or write an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Of the Gentleman's <hi>Knowledge.</hi> There is no Fortune that <hi>Knowledge</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes, or that ſtands more in need of it, than a Gentleman's; without it an Eſtate is rather cumberſome than uſeful, and the ignorant Owner muſt be the Tool or Inſtrument of anothers Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Intereſt, the Prey of a menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or the Property of an imperious Wife or wanton Child, or which is worſe, of ſome crafty Retainer, who
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39250:35"/>
grows impudent with the favour, rich with the Spoils, both of the Honour and Fortune of his Maſter: The beſt that can befal ſuch a one is, if he have the good luck to light into good hands, and joyn himſelf with a right Party, he may be the Apendage of ſome others Fortune, the ſhade and umbria of another, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepts the Smiles and Thanks due to him; he may, in a word, talk and act by the Senſe and Reaſon of his Party. This is a poor and contemptible Condition to a Man of Birth and Fortune, to be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of imploying or improving the Advantages he is born to, and to be only the Prey or Tool of the Cunning, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Ambition, and impotent Paſſions of others; or at beſt, the Inſtrument of a wiſer Man; for the Wiſe is born to rule the Fool.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this all, the Gentleman's Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is ſo much the more worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, becauſe he appears to be born to greater Opportunities of Knowledge, as he that ſtands upon a more eminent height does naturally enjoy a more free and open proſpect.</p>
                     <p>But what is worſe than all this, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician Fortune joyned with a Plebeian
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39250:36"/>
Underſtanding, renders a Man not more liable to ſuffer Miſchief, than apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them; for if the Man have much Paſſion, and no Underſtanding, as Wealth is apt to inſpire Men with Pride and Wilfulneſs, thô it cannot with Wiſdom, what can be expected from ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath power enough to execute his Paſſions, and no reaſon to reſtrain them, who looks upon it as a contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be oppoſed, and thô he hath no ſenſe himſelf, is too big to hear it from another; what can ſuch a Man be but a Plague to himſelf and others, and what can his Wealth and Intereſt be, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs Inſtruments of Evil. It is then indiſpenſibly neceſſary, as well for the avoiding Evil as doing good, that the great man be endowed with a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing he ought to be well acquainted with is Religion, as the only ſource of ſolid Wiſdom, and the main ground of a juſt and laſting Reputation; nor indeed can I ſee how a Man can be conſiderable without it; for thô baſe Ends require baſe Inſtruments in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes, I ſee not how either Prince or People can truſt thoſe Men who are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39250:36"/>
falſe to God and themſelves, 'tis ſcarce to be expected, that he who Sacrifices his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and his Reaſon, that is, himſelf to any Luſt or Paſſion, ſhould be nice and ſcrupulous of giving up a remoter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Obligation to it. But when I ſay the Gentleman ſhould be acquainted with Religion, I do not mean that he ſhould perplex or amuſe himſelf with the Diſputes that have debauch'd, or Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Niceties which have diſpirited or enervated Chriſtianity, I would have him have ſo much illumination as to be able to diſtinguiſh between Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Politicks, Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Phanſies and Whimſies of Man: I would have him thoroughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Reaſons and Grounds of our common Chriſtianity, and ſtudy and ruminate them till he feel the power of them, and find himſelf formed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them. He underſtands Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion well, who learns from it what it is to be juſt, and derives from it Courage enough to dare to be ſo. I ſhould think it a neceſſary part of this Knowledge, or at leaſt a good Accompliſhment in a Gentleman to be ſo far acquainted with Eccleſiaſtical Story, as not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39250:37"/>
what influence Religion, or the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of it has upon the World, and what uſe cunning Men have ever made of it, by what Degrees or what Arts the Maxims of the World have been incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into Religion, and the Church hath wound and inſinuated it ſelf into the State. Thus you will diſcern what the true Meaſures of Religion are, you will have a juſt regard for wiſe Conſtitutions without bigottry; you will free your ſelves from all thoſe Doubts and Scruples which uſher in Atheiſm and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, in a word, you will find Religion the true Standard of Wiſdom and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the effectual Inſtrument of private and publick Good, and the infallible Guide to Honour and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Next to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Religion, follows the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the World, which may be divided into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Matters and Men, which is ſo neceſſary in every part, in every act of Life, but eſpecially of a publick one, that I cannot but wonder at the vanity of ſuch as can fancy it poſſible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſolid Reputation in their Country, and fill any Station honourably or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily without it. The confidence of an
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39250:37"/>
Emperick, or other ſuch wretched Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors and Undertakers, ſeems to me Modeſty and Vertue, compared to the ſhameleſneſs and wickedneſs of ſuch men as obtrude themſelves upon Affairs of a publick Nature, unſtudied, unver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in Things or Men, that is totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, which whoever conſiders the difficulty of managing them well, or the miſchievous conſequences of miſcarrying in them, muſt confeſs. Let the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man therefore ſtudy the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Realm, its Changes and Revolutions in their Cauſes, Progreſs, and Effects, its Natural and Political Strengths and Weakneſſes, Defects and Excellencies, together with its Foreign Intereſts, Relation, and Dependances; nor let him be wholly ignorant of the Frame and Polity of other Kingdoms, thô he ought to be beſt verſed in our own; he muſt travel abroad, but dwell at home; for I would have him have a Veneration, not Superſtition, for the Laws and Cuſtoms of his own Country; for I doubt the Wiſdom of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not great enough to juſtifie the neglect, much leſs contempt of that of Foreign Ones; and becauſe what they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39250:38"/>
call the Law of Nature is only the Law of right Reaſon, in thoſe great Precepts of it, which ſeem immutable and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and the ſame in all Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He ought not to be a ſtranger to this, leaſt being ignorant of the true Grounds of Humane Society, and of the Nature and Obligation of particular Laws; every new Emergency, Change, or Deviation from the common Road, diſcover his Inſufficiency; for 'tis a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing to ſee how, through the ſimplicity and weakneſs of ſome, and the ſubtlety and cunning of others, Laws which ſhould be the Fences and Bulwarks of the People, are often made only their Chains and Fetters; and thoſe publick and ſolemn Ties which were deſigned to ſtrengthen and fortifie the Conſtitution, become the moſt fatal Engines of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and ſubverting it. I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many, who would be excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a regular and calm ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that are miſerably perplexed, and at a loſs, or wretchedly abuſed or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon in a diſordered and unſettled one; like a Perſon of my Acquaintance, who rides well in incloſed and narrow Roads, but her Brains begin to ſwim, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39250:38"/>
her heart to fail her on Downs and Plains.</p>
                     <p>After all, that I may not ſeem to be treating rather of Speculation than Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to have propoſed ſuch an Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Knowledge, as if I were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending rather a Life of Study than of Buſineſs, I muſt put you in mind, that the deſign of this ſort of Learning ought to be to make men Wiſe, not Subtle, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, not Diſputative. That Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Diligence in Matters minute, or ſubtle, has more in it of amuſement than uſe, and that to lay the Foundation too deep and broad, does ſeldom quit the coſt; and, in one word, it ſeems to me to be in Policy, as in Religion, he is the moſt prudent who beſt underſtands the particular Laws or Precepts of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Station, as he is the moſt religious who is beſt learned, not in the univerſal Scheme of Theology, but the regulation of his own Affections, and the conduct of his own Life.</p>
                     <p>But in vain does he ſtudy Things who knows not Men, for Man is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Power and Policy, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever knows how to manage and gain an Aſcendant over him, is the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39250:39"/>
in his Country, and able to do the greateſt miſchief or the greateſt good: But when I talk of knowing Men, I mean not only ſuch a <hi>knowledge</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons as may inſtruct you what to hope, or what to fear from them, what imployments or truſts they are fit or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for, and, in a word, who are proper or improper Inſtruments in different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, Times and Circumſtances; who are fit to be the Partners of your Pleaſures and Diverſions, who of your Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Secrets, and ſuch like; but alſo the knowledge of Humane Nature to be thoroughly read in all the Springs and Reſorts of Human Actions, in all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paſſions and Diſeaſes of the mind of Man, with all their Cauſes and Cures, and to be able to diſtinguiſh the genuine and natural from the acquired and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Perſon; and becauſe not ſimple Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, but Times and Ages, Nations, Cities, and leſſer Bodies and Societies, have their particular Temper and Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, theſe muſt not be neglected neither. This is the Knowledge, which together with a dexterous uſe and application of it, is the very life and ſoul of worldly Prudence, and makes up the beginning,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39250:39"/>
middle, and end of true Policy; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, both with reſpect to the Publick, and a Man's own Good, that ought to be a Rule for the Man of Buſineſs which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes for a Biſhop, <hi>Let him first learn to rule his own Houſe well.</hi> He that will be truly wiſe, ſhould know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt, e're he goes about to know the World, and begin the practiſe of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks in his own Family, and in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and due adminiſtration of his Domeſtick Affairs, in which if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſucceed, I muſt confeſs I cannot ſee what Encouragement either Prince or People can have to confide in ſuch a one; for the diſorders or diſſipations of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Fortune are very ominous Preſages of a Mal-adminiſtration of publick Truſt. Nor can I ſee what can induce ſuch a Man to undertake it, but the meer hopes of repairing his private Dilapidations with the Stones and Timber of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                     <p>But after all, how neceſſary ſoever I account Knowledge in a Gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in an Active Station, yet I cannot but obſerve, that whether we regard the Publick or the Private, Wickedneſs has ever been more fatal and diſhonourable to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39250:40"/>
both, than Ignorance, and all Truſts have ſuffered more in the hands of the falſe and the baſe, than of the unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient: Therefore</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Gentleman ought to be enriched with Vertues, eſpecially thoſe which become his Rank and Station. Knowledge is but the Seed of Vertue, and like that, it only rots and putrifies, if it grow not up into excellent Habits, and bring not forth the Fruits of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions. There is ſcarce any Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which does not require a particular Vertue, either to diſcharge or adorn it; one Patience, another Courage, a third Vigilance, and ſo on; there being ſcarce any Office or Buſineſs which is not liable to ſome particular Inconveniencies and Temptations: But it being impoſſible for me to proſecute all theſe, I will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on two or three which are eſſential to all true Greatneſs and Honour, and if I am not much miſtaken, to a happy and proſperous diſpatch of all Affairs, I am ſure to the Security and Felicity of the Publick and Private, theſe are Integrity, Magnanimity, Humanity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Integrity. By Integrity I mean two things, Juſtice and Truth: The firſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39250:40"/>
to regulate our Actions; the ſecond our Words. Nor do I take Juſtice in a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly barretting Senſe, as if the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had acquitted himſelf of a due well enough, if there were any plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to excuſe a Violation or Omiſſion of it; as if he were to regard more what the Law could compel, than what Honour did oblige him to; and by Honour I mean the Teſtimony of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, both concerning his diligent and impartial Enquiries after the right and ſincerity in purſuing it; for I would not have him appear to do right, rather out of the fear of Infamy, than love of Vertue. The word of a Gentleman ought to be fixed and unmoveable as Fate, ſacred and inviolable as the Altar. Contracts, and Evidences, and Seals, and Oaths were deviſed to tye Fools, and Knaves, and Cowards: Honour and Conſcience are the more firm and ſacred ties of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. Nor muſt this Honour extend only to private Dealings, but much more to publick; in which, good God! how comely, how noble is it to ſee Integrity triumphing over Intereſt and Paſſion? To ſee a great Man preferring Truth and Juſtice to the favour or menaces of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39250:41"/>
Princes, and readily quitting all Intereſt and all Parties to ſupport the publick Safety and Honour, or fall with it. But as Heroick as I would have the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I would not have him vain, I would not have him led or impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by empty Noiſe and Names, I would have him love a good Name, but much more a good Conſcience, for I would have him as Judicious as Reſolved, as Bright and Luminous as Brave and Inflexible; for I admire not an Integrity that bids defiance to Prudence and right Reaſon; I love a ſteaddy Faith and unmoveable Juſtice, but not Romance and Fancy; I would have a great Man not inſenſible of a difference between Loyalty and Slavery, between Tyranny and Anarchy; and in the ſame manner he muſt be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between a Serpentine Subtlety and a ſtupid Inſufficiency, and want of neceſſary Addreſs and Dexterity; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a competency of Knowledge, all will be but Folly, not Integrity, Vanity, not Conſtancy. As there is an Integrity in Action, ſo is there in Speech to, it ſeems to me not to conſiſt in bare Truth only, but alſo in an ingenious openneſs and freedom, cloudineſs and ambiguity;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39250:41"/>
ſeems to me rather fit to diſguiſe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Deſign, than to pourtray or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Sentiments of a wiſe or an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Mind, yet in Words, as well as Deeds, there is an Extream, thô frankneſs and openneſs in Converſation, like a free and generous Air, become a Gentleman. I would not have Freedom violate Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Simplicity and Openneſs leſſen Greatneſs; too many and wide Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if they add Beauty, do certainly diminiſh the ſtrength of a Building.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The next vertue beſeeming a Gentleman, is Magnanimity: By which I do not mean an empty Tumor, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Greatneſs of Mind, which ought to diſcover it ſelf in every Inſtance of his Life; I ſay in every Inſtance, for I count it not enough to bear Diſappointments with moderation, unleſs he bear his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſo too: I count it not enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Dangers with Courage, unleſs he encounter his Pleaſures with as great; and in a word, there ought to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing even in his Diverſions and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, as well as in his Buſineſs and Employment, that may ſpeak the ſtrength and wealth, and ſelf ſufficiency of his Mind. You'l eaſily conclude this with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39250:42"/>
me, if you allow theſe two or three things to be eſſential to true Greatneſs of Mind; an Invincible Courage and Reſolution, a rational and generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and an enlarged and publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which you cannot but allow, unleſs you think that the Coward and Slave, the Sluggard or Sott, the Sordid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Selfiſh may be reckon'd amongſt the Magnanimous. But what Principle, what Foundation is able to ſupport ſo mighty a weight? Natural Courage may make a Man brave Danger, or if that will not Ambition may, while it preſents him with a more formidable Evil if he turn his back upon the other; but what ſhall make the Man modeſt and humble in his Triumphs, who was gallant and daring in Fight? Paſſion and Revenge may make Men firm and fierce in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts and Oppoſitions, but what can make a Man forgive when he is in a Condition to revenge an Injury. The luſt of Power and Honour and Wealth, that is, Self-love may render a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and induſtrious, but what is it that can prevail with him to Sacrifice his own Intereſt and his Families to publick Good? Honour has been generally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39250:42"/>
thought the moſt likely Principle to do all this, I muſt confeſs, a Breaſt infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with love of Honour, ſeems to me incapable of any mean or baſe Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but then the Notion of Honour ought to be juſtly ſtated; for if by this we underſtand the Smiles and Courtſhips of the Great, or the Praiſes and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the People, it had need be in ſettled Times a wiſe Court and a modeſt People: I doubt there is not Judgment enough in the People, nor Plainneſs and Simplicity enough in Courts to give Men and Actions a true value; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if a Man would propoſe Honour as the reward of his Actions, it ought to be that which conſiſts in the Approbation of ſuch who are able and diſintereſſed Judges; a miſtake in this point is often of very ill conſequence, and perverts the whole Courſe of Humane Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying either into factious Oppoſition, or ſordid and unworthy Compliance. Nor is this the only Inconvenience that the Love of Honour is obnoxious to, that Men may be miſled and abuſed by falſe and miſtaken Notions of it, but it alſo often happens, that Envy and Emulation in particular Men, or the Violence of a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39250:43"/>
prevailing Faction, or the Iniquity of Times may ſtifle and oppreſs the Merit, or traduce and blaſt the Integrity of the moſt excellent Actions, in which Caſes, I doubt, the ſecret Opinion of two or three vertuous Men, or an Expectation of greater Juſtice from future Times, will be too weak a Cordial to ſupport an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Vertue, if its only Nouriſhment and ſuſtenance be Honour. I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Religion is the only Baſis on which Magnanimity can ſtand, by which I mean a love of rational and vertuous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon wiſe and ſolid Grounds, a ſecret Delight and Complacency in the performance of them, accompanied with the Peace and Serenity of Mind that ſprings from Reflection upon them, and the Joy which a firm Perſuaſion that God will be our Rewarder breeds in us; this, as it will ſecure us againſt the Errors, ſo will it againſt the Inconſtancy and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the World; this will miniſter ſufficient Motives to generous Actions, when we meet nothing but Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from all things elſe; this, if it will not make a publick Employment honourable, will always make it ſafe; this, if it cannot render great Places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39250:43"/>
will ever render Retirement plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and in all the Changes of Times and Humours, will preſerve a Man ſteddy and calm in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt I recommend Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I muſt not forget that there are Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Vices which often are wont to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp its Name. I never thought that the love of our Country did imply a neglect, much leſs a contempt of our private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: That a vain Confidence or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in provoaking and irritating Dangers ought to paſs for Courage; for this were to make Fortitude and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence incompatible: Nor do I think that a violent Intruſion into Buſineſs, or an indiſcreet intangling a Man's ſelf in much, or ingaging in any that is foreign or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, deſerves the Name of Induſtry or Activity, or Pride, Stiffneſs, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs, the Name of Firmneſs and Conſtancy; for, in a word, I would have Magnanimity rather lovely than haughty, rather revered than dreaded; Therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Humanity is the next Vertue to be aimed at. Nothing can be more fitly joyned with Magnanimity than Compaſſion, with Courage than Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39250:44"/>
nor with the felicity of a great Fortune, than Charity or Bounty. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that there is a truer Character of Greatneſs, than to be a Sanctuary to the Injured, a Patron to Vertue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a Counſellor to thoſe that Err, and a ſupport to the Afflicted, the Needy and Defenceleſs. In theſe things conſiſt the Life and Subſtance of Humanity, the Ornamental part of it is <hi>Affability</hi> or <hi>Courteouſneſs;</hi> the Art of Behaviour lies in a narrow Compaſs, the whole skill of it conſiſting in obliging, which he ſhall never miſs, who has once poſſeſſed his Soul with Tenderneſs and Goodneſs, for then every Word, every Action, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Air of Deportment, will be animated with a reſiſtleſs ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will be nothing elſe but the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture and Expreſſion of thoſe excellent Diſpoſitions, by this means too the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment will be Natural, not Artificial; and thô it be generally kind, it will be more particularly ſo, where it meets with a more moving Occaſion, to which if it be added, that the Carriage of a Gentleman ought to be Humble, but not Popular, Courteous, but not Cheap or Proſtitute, you will decline all the conſiderable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39250:44"/>
to which Affability is obnoxious.</p>
                     <p>It was the Cuſtom of the Ancients to deliver their Inſtruction in ſhort and plain Sentences, without a labour'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation or paſſionate Enforcement. And certainly there is ſuch a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authority in the Dictates of Truth and Wiſdom, ſuch a Divinity, Majeſty, and Lovelineſs in ſolid Vertues, that did the Simplicity and Probity obtain in theſe, which is ſuppoſed to have done in thoſe Times, advice of this ſort would eaſily make its way to the Hearts of Men without the Aſſiſtance of any Motives. But I dare not be either ſo confident of my own Performance, or of the Times, as not to think it neceſſary to cloſe the Advice of theſe Paragraphs, with ſome Arguments and Motives to theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                     <p>Shall I make uſe here of the Topicks of Religion? Shall I invite you to Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Magnanimity from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Omniſcience and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God? Shall I put you in mind how little Sordidneſs, Falſhood and Fear; how little Pride and Inſolence can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Principles and Perſwaſions of a Chriſtian, concerning the Emptineſs and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39250:45"/>
Vanity of this World, or the true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and laſting Glory of another? Shall I preſs you to Humanity, to Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility, by calling to your remembrance the Life of Jeſus, your Frailty and Mortality, and what is worſe, your Sins and Follies? Shall I ſhow you how mutable and inconſtant your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is; and if it were not, how acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental fantaſtick and inconſiderable a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction this makes between you and perſons of a lower Rank? and that they ſtand at leaſt upon the ſame level with you, with reſpect to the ſubſtantial and ſolid Intereſts of Humane Nature, that is, the favour of God, Vertue, Grace, and Glory? Alas! I am afraid you have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally but little Reliſh or Guſt of this ſort of Arguments.</p>
                     <p>But have you as little value for your Country as Religion? Are you as little moved by the Ruin of this, as the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of that? Behold your Country once formidable abroad, and well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact within; ah! now what Reproach and Contumelies does it not ſuffer abroad? what Convulſions at home? Its Wealth has neither Service nor Defence in it. Its Numbers are without Courage, and its
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39250:45"/>
Forces have nothing of Strength or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in them. Why all this, it bleeds in your Factions and Diviſions, it reels and ſtaggers under your Softneſs and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; 'tis betrayed by your Falſhood and Cowardize; Ah! that its Reformation might begin where its Degeneracy has, and that it might recover by your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues the Honour it has loſt and forfeited by your Vices. Pardon me, I do not here ſuppoſe that there are none exempt from this Accuſation; that in the Body of the Nobility and Gentry there are not, even in this degenerate Age, ſome bright Inſtances of a true Engliſh Courage and Integrity; I only wiſh that there were more, that there were enough to Atone for the reſt, and to prop up this decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>State.</hi> Nor is it a petulant Humor, but a Zeal for your Honour particularly, as well as that of the Nations, that now acts me; for give me leave to put you in mind at length</p>
                     <p>That your Honour, your Intereſt, and your Happineſs depend upon your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Magnanimity and Humanity; nor is it poſſible that the one ſhould ſurvive the other. Firſt your <hi>Honour.</hi> The whole World is poſſeſſed in favour of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39250:46"/>
theſe Vertues; and however it hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome other, theſe haVe ever been in vogue, not amongſt the beſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but worſt of Mankind. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed underſtood that there are ſome who have openly profeſſed and defended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Incontinence, but I think none ever yet have in earneſt undertook the Patronage of <hi>Cowardize, Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inhumanity,</hi> or <hi>Inſolence.</hi> I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet met with any, who have not thought it ſcandalous and reproachful to find leſs <hi>Faith,</hi> leſs <hi>Honour,</hi> leſs <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or if you pleaſe more ſhifting <hi>Cowardiſe, Falſhood,</hi> and <hi>Sordidneſs</hi> in his Lordſhip, or his Worſhip, than in a Groom or Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key. Nor did I ever find, that Lands and Scutcheons, wealthy Relations and honourable Anceſtors, were ever looked upon as Apologies or Mitigations, but rather Aggravations of ſuch Baſeneſs and Degeneracy; nor could any Man ever think it a Commendation to be the Sinks and Sewers of a Noble Family, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of an ancient, and once ſtately Pile, or the Lees and Dreggs of a rich Liquor long ſince drawn off, and evaporated. Nor does your Honour only, but Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Intereſt depend on theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39250:46"/>
If you want theſe, I ſee not what you can poſſeſs, that can either gain you the Favour of the Prince, or Eſteem of the People: This ſure is the Reaſon why theſe Vertues have ever been in ſuch credit in the World, becauſe their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo neceſſary, ſo univerſally ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whether to the Publick, or to Friends and Dependants; now that Integrity which can give others ground confidently to rely upon you, that Generoſity and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity which raiſes their Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, does naturally give you an Authority and Aſcendant over them, and you become the Maſters of their Lives and Fortunes, whilſt they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Protection or Improvement of them from your Vertues: To theſe then you muſt owe the Patronage and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe above you, the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Love, and Eſteem of thoſe below you, without which, what can you ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, what can you enjoy truly great or conſiderable; you are impotent and Contemptible as Ploughmen and Sailers when ſolitary and abandon'd; your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and Dependance, your Friends and Admirers make you powerful: In ſhort, a Man of Birth and Fortune that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:39250:47"/>
cowardly, ſelfiſh and proud, has not in my Judgment, or deſerves not to have half the Intereſt an honeſt Yeoman or plain-dealing Trades-man has in City or Country; for what Confidence can be placed in ſuch a one; will he be tender of the Honour of his Country, or his Friend, who has no ſenſe of his own? or will he ever be either a good Patron or Friend, who is ready to ſacrifice all to his private Avarice? Nor is it a matter of ſmall importance, that Reputation founded in Vertue ſurmounts all ſorts of Difficulties, and Crowns all Undertakings with Succeſs, and ſince Men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backward when they are jealous and diſtruſtful, but prompt and forward where they are ſecure and confident: It has ever been obſerved, that Integrity (if not deſtitute of competent Prudence) has in diſpatch of Affairs ever out-ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Craft and Subtlety. But the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Conſideration of all is, that theſe Vertues, if they be not the ſureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Greatneſs, are doubtleſs of Happineſs; for they will make a man find a tranquility in his Mind, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in his Fortune: The Conſcience of a Man's own Uprightneſs will alleviate
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39250:47"/>
the toil of Buſineſs, and ſweeten the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ill Succeſs and Diſappointments, and give him an humble Confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, when the Ingratitude of Man, or the Iniquity of Times, rob him of all other Reward.</p>
                     <p>Having thus given an Account of theſe two things, wherein conſiſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of a Man of Buſineſs, that is, <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> I will proceed to the conſideration of the third Rule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Gentleman ought to be Conſtant, Reſolved, and Vigorous in his Motion. <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> whether in the acquiſition of Knowledge, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Vertue, or Management of Affairs are of the greateſt moment and importance. I ever prefer a ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fine Edge; Induſtry and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before Wit and Parts: He that makes a daily progreſs, how ſlow ſoever it be, will in time reach its Stage; vaſt Bodies and mighty Armies, by conſtant marches, have travelled through thoſe unknown Regions, which a ſingle Perſon would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpair of compaſſing in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. To what a height does the Tree raiſe its Head, thô its Root fix in the heart of the Earth, becauſe thô it grow
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39250:48"/>
ſlowly, and even imperceptibly, yet it grows conſtantly, and receives ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion every moment. This Rule, as I inſinuated before, is applicable to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Vertue, and Buſineſs. To <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> to what would not an ingenious Perſon, furniſhed with all aids of Science, advance his Proſpect, if he uſed but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate induſtry, and proceeded regularly; What could there be in any Science, which were either of any uſe, or any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that could eſcape him? and other things ought not to ſtop him; they may be his diverſion, but ought not to be his ſtudy. I believe there are few Natures but are capable, if not of eminent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, yet of ſuch Improvement as may render them conſiderable and uſeful enough, if they would apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy of Knowledge with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tolerable vigour, or exert their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour with any regularity and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? 'Tis owing to laſineſs and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the ſlow and heavy attain not to ſuch Abilities as might ſuffice to ſet them off, and to make them ſhow tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well: And 'tis to the ſame that the quick and witty owe their want of all Solidity and Judgment, while they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:39250:48"/>
only enough to make the World juſtly condemn them, as wanting to themſelves and their Country, being bad Stewards of a naturally rich and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable Eſtate, careleſs and ill Maſters of good Parts.</p>
                     <p>Nor is Conſtancy leſs ſerviceable in the purſuit of Vertue than of Knowledge. Vertue, when acquired, is confeſſed by all to be eaſie and delightful, becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and rational; but to acquire it, this is the difficulty; but 'tis ſuch a one as Conſtancy and Courage would eaſily vanquiſh: 'Tis generally thought there is in moſt at firſt ſome ſort of impetus towards good, which if it were conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheriſhed, would ſoon turn into habit and nature; but fits and heats of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, broken and interrupted Eſſays and Attempts, do only keep up ſo much guſt for Vertue, as makes us a little diſguſt the Enjoyments of Sin, and preſerves ſo much of Conſcience as ſerves to diſturb and perplex us. But be it how it will, let us ſuppoſe Man infected in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what is worſe, over-run by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious habits, yet even then the ſame care, watchfulneſs, and diſcipline that cures a Chronicle Diſtemper of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:39250:49"/>
would heal an habitual Diſeaſe of the Mind; and one may reform and enrich a degenerate Mind with as little pains as it will coſt to recover a decayed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>But let me return to my main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that is, the Conduct of <hi>Civil Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Here, I am ſure, an uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and regular vigour is exacted by all; I have ſeldom obſerved Men of great Ability do great things without great diligence and reſolution; I am ſure I have ſeen them miſcarry fouly, when Perſons of lower Talents have ſucceeded very well: Nay, the truth is, vigour and reſolution are ſuch noble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that whoever appears endowed with them, can never himſelf miſcarry, thô his Deſigns ſometimes may; he can never be a loſer in Honour and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but generally appears a great Man, even in the moſt unfortunate Accidents, and makes even ill Succeſs it ſelf atteſt his ſufficiency. But commonly difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties give way to the diligence and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great Men; and if to day will not, to morrow will ſmile upon their Enterprizes; there are lucky Minutes in Buſineſs, when what before had Wind
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:39250:49"/>
and Tide againſt it, moves with the Stream, whether will not he then carry his point, who never lets ſlip the lucky Moment thorough Negligence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails through Cowardiſe or Laſineſs to urge and puſh on his good Succeſs?</p>
                     <p>But how much ſoever <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> be commended, as moſt ſerviceable to Succeſs in Buſineſs, as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfections that Man is capable of, and the beſt Inſtrument of attaining all others, yet we muſt not forget that the ſtrength of our Nature is ſoon broken if it be always ſtrained, and the fineſt parts are ſoon tired and diſpirited if they be inceſſantly imployed; That Man has a deſign to carry on far nobler and more important than this of <hi>Civil Buſineſs,</hi> and that ſo far at leaſt the Pleaſures of Life are to be mingled with its Toils and Troubles, as to enable us the better to undergo them; Therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Gentleman's Time ought not to be ſo wholly taken up in Buſineſs, as not to leave Vacancies for <hi>Religion, Meditation, Friendſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diverſion.</hi> They are two extreams fatal to Happineſs, to have no Buſineſs at all, or ſo much as leaves no room for Books
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:39250:50"/>
or Friends, for <hi>Meditation</hi> or neceſſary <hi>Diverſion;</hi> for this makes Life very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and very dull, it makes Buſineſs meer Drudgery, and places the great Man in a more toilſome condition than the mean One, and makes him wiſh for the uſe of his Tenant and Servants. Nor is this the only Evil of an uninterrupted purſuit of worldly Buſineſs, but what is worſe, it extinguiſhes all guſt of Vertue, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of heavenly things, and inſtead of the Courage and Peace with which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion inſpires Men, it leaves them without any rational Support or Comfort, either conſuming with perplexed and anxious Thoughts about the event of things, or hardened into a neglect, if not contempt of Religion, propoſing to themſelves no other or higher end of Life than the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting themſelves well in the ſtation they are, and aſcribing the iſſue of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to no other Providence than ſuch as they are daily wont to imploy about them, and to ſuch other Accidents as they have obſerved them ever and anon ſubject to.</p>
                     <p>When I demand a vacant Time for <hi>Religion,</hi> it muſt not be ſuppoſed that I do not look upon Religion as the firſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:39250:50"/>
and greateſt Buſineſs of Humane Life, it being in vain to gain the whole World for him who loſes his Soul, or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in preſerving or advancing the Peace and Welfare of the Publick for him, whoſe Mind is filled with Diſorder and Guilt; I do therefore ſuppoſe all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Day, ſo conducted, as to become Inſtances of Chriſtian Vertue, I ſuppoſe Juſtice and Integrity, Courage and Bounty, Patience and Gentleneſs, mingling themſelves in the diſcharge of every <hi>Civil Buſineſs.</hi> And then the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for which I demand ſome vacant Moments, is that of publick and private Devotion, without which it is impoſſible for the great Man either to preſerve Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation without, or Peace within. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion is not only an Act of Worſhip due to God, but in a Gentleman a Teſtimony of the Honour which he has for the Community he is of, and an expreſſion of Charity towards thoſe who are influenced by his Example. Nor is private Devotion leſs neceſſary than publick, not only leaſt publick without private degenerate into Formality, into a meer ſhow without the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; nor yet becauſe every Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:39250:51"/>
flows firſt from his Domeſticks, who can have no great veneration for him, who appears to have none for his God, thô even theſe Reaſons ought not to be contemned, but eſpecially becauſe every Man has particular wants and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obligations, and none more than the great One, and therefore muſt offer up to God his particular Petitions and Prayers. I cannot therefore tell how to think that he who does not begin and cloſe the Day with Prayers to God, can believe there is one; he that does not invoke Providence, ſeems to defie it; and he who ſacrificeth not to God, ſeems to me to ſacrifice only to his own Nets.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Meditation,</hi> 'tis ſo eſſential a part of <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo indiſpenſible a preparative for Devotion, that I ſhould not have placed it here by it ſelf, did I not extend its deſign ſomething further. <hi>Meditation</hi> is that <hi>Act,</hi> which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, does moſt delight and nouriſh the Mind, which, of all others, is moſt fit to raiſe and to ſtrengthen it. In other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we ſeem to move mechanically, in this alone rationally. In all other, our Reaſon ſeems confined and fettered by I know not what Preſcriptions, Cuſtoms,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:39250:51"/>
and Circumſtances; in this alone it ſeems to enjoy its native freedom and liberty, rambling with an uncontrouled Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and with delight ſtretching and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it ſelf. In all other things, the Mind ſeems to be impreſſed and mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Matter and Buſineſs about which it is converſant; but in this it gives what Forms and Circumſtances it pleaſes to both; in this it has a kind of creative or productive Power, and I know not what ſort of deſpotick Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. In a word, he who is ignorant of the force of <hi>Meditation,</hi> is a ſtranger to the trueſt Pleaſure of Humane Life, to the moſt uſeful taking and natural act of the Humane Soul. But I forget what I mainly intended, which was to tell you that the uſe of <hi>Meditation</hi> conſiſts either in Reflection or Preparation, as regarding alike yeſterday and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; 'tis highly neceſſary that he looks back upon his day paſt, who lies under ſo many Temptations to waſte it, that he whoſe Actions are of ſo much greater importance than thoſe of private Men, and fall unavoidably under a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſevere Cenſure, do the more carefully ſcan them over. Nor is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:39250:52"/>
leſs neceſſary than Reflection, for this gives order to your Affairs, and forms the Mind into a fit and juſt <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;</hi> it prevents ſurprizes, removes difficulties, and gives beauty and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your whole Conduct.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Diverſion,</hi> I ſhall treat of them fully in their proper place, and therefore ſhall ſpeak but a word of them here. 'Tis a hard matter, it may be, for great Men to have ſincere Friends, but this being a Purchaſe of ſo great a value, deſerves they ſhould lay out all their Art and Intereſt upon it; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the advantage of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Condition that it clears our Notions, corrects our Errors, confirms our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, enlarges our Joys, and leſſens our Troubles, it is to Men in an eminent ſtation more peculiarly neceſſary, both as the Ornament and Support of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Diverſion,</hi> it ever muſt be ſuch as may conſiſt with the dignity of the Perſon, or the urgency of his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as may not leſſen his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or waſte his Time; ſuch as may refreſh and recruit Nature, and from which he may return to his Buſineſs with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39250:52"/>
new vigour and new appetite; and it were very well if Diverſions were ſo wiſely contrived, that they might at once delight and improve the Mind: I ſhould therefore think that Phyſick or Husbandry, the Principles of any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mechanick Performances, Muſick, Architecture, and ſuch like, might be proper Entertainments of vacant hours: But if the Health of the Body, as well as Pleaſure of the Mind be aimed at in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> it were well to have always ready ſome wiſe Friends, by whoſe help and converſation, the Time you beſtow upon the Health of the Body, may not be utterly loſt to the Mind.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible I have been guilty in this Diſcourſe of the ſame Fault which all, who write Morals with any Spirit, do generally fall into, that is, propoſing a greater Perfection than is commonly attainable, and of forming my Models and Ideas rather by Speculation than the Practiſe of Mankind; but this will be eaſily pardon'd by ſuch as remember that the Copy will ever fall ſhort of the Original, and that men will eaſily of themſelves bend and accommodate the exacteſt Rule to the Frailties and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39250:53"/>
of Humane Life. Nor do I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain forget, when I preſs Gentlemen to the nobleſt heights of Vertue, that they are expoſed to more numerous and more violent ſolicitations to Vice than other Men, I know it; but at the ſame time, I remember too, that they always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a higher Spirit, and a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Education; that their Vertue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhines with a double luſtre, its own, and that of their Fortune; ſo that moderate Attainments in them make a greater ſhow than the more perfect and accompliſhed in Men of a lower Sphere; and finally, that thoſe Advantages and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives which they enjoy by their Birth and Station, do put them in a better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than other Men, to defend their true Liberty, and to purſue thoſe Methods which Reaſon and Virtue dictate.</p>

the World know, that I have found more <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> more <hi>Clearneſs</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> amongſt this ſort of Men, than I ever could amongſt others, whoſe Quality and Education raiſed my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations higher, it will be therefore no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, if any Endeavours of mine, can render them any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service.</p>
                     <p>There is no Condition of Life free from Temptations and Difficulties, apt to embroil our Happineſs and infect our Innocence, and therefore neither this of <hi>Traders;</hi> the Evils they are ſubject to may be reduced to two Heads, their miſcarrying in <hi>Trade,</hi> or in <hi>Religion.</hi> I will therefore begin with ſuch Rules as may ſerve to prevent the former, and then proceed to ſuch as concern the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>If we trace the ruine of ſuch as fail or break, back to its Original, we ſhall find it generally to be either <hi>Idleneſs</hi> or <hi>Pride. Idleneſs,</hi> the Parent of all ſottiſh Vices; <hi>Pride</hi> the Parent of expenſive Follies and ruinous Projects. I will therefore lay down theſe two Rules as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>Trader</hi>'s Secular Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he muſt be diligent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39250:54"/>
and Induſtrious. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he muſt not be above his Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He muſt be <hi>Diligent</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious.</hi> You ſeem born for <hi>Induſtry;</hi> and thô ſome pretend to be ſent into the World only to enjoy a Fortune; 'tis plain you are firſt to raiſe one; and thô there may be ſome Fortunate men in the World, that ſeem to thrive rather by Chance than Vertue, and owe more to the Care of others than their own, yet I am ſure, in the ordinary Methods of <hi>Providence, Diligence</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> are the High-way to <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Plenty, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> to wiſe and ſecure Enjoyments. And I know not with what confidence Men can promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Bleſſing and Favour of God on any other tearms. He has made nothing on purpoſe to be idle and uſeleſs: The heavenly Bodies never ceaſe to yield their Light and Influence, nor the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial ones their Fruit. We our ſelves do ſubſiſt by a continual Motion; and ſhould our Blood and Spirits grow dull and ſluggiſh, our Life muſt needs expire with their Activity; <hi>Man is born to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as the Sparks fly upward;</hi> our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Endowments deſtine and urge
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39250:55"/>
us to it, the neceſſities and wants of this needy beggerly ſtate, in which Nature, how kind ſoever it was to the golden Age, does not furniſh us with any thing, without <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> exact and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, and the Laws of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety oblige us to it; for it is but fit that every one ſhould contribute his ſhot for the Entertainment of the Publick, and that he ſhould nor, like a Droan, be feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained by the labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of others. And ſo far, laſtly, is Chriſtianity from abrogating this Law of Nature, that it earneſtly inforces it, <hi>Let ours learn to maintain good Works for neceſſary uſes, that they be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful;</hi> that is, that they be not a ſhame and burden to themſelves and Families, to the Commonwealth or Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Propoſe not then, I addreſs my ſelf here to Apprentices and Beginners; propoſe not to exempt your ſelves from that Univerſal Law of Labour and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to which the whole Creation is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; you eſpecially who lie under more immediate and particular Obligations to it. 'Tis an unaccountable folly for one, who is to make his Fortune in the World, to apply himſelf to <hi>Trade,</hi> rather as a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39250:55"/>
                        <hi>Diverſion</hi> than Buſineſs, and to deſign it only as a Support and Fund for Sloth and Luxury: 'Tis madneſs and phrenſie to propoſe to be Maſter of his Time ere he be Maſter of his <hi>Trade,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Pleaſures before he has made Proviſion to defray the Expence of them, and yet this, I doubt, is too too general a practiſe; whereas would young men conſider the matter aright, they would find that they do but prevent their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by gathering of them before they be ripe, and do but make their Troubles and Vexations endleſs, by indulging their Eaſe and Lazineſs too ſoon. Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Projects! to propoſe at once to live idly, and yet to thrive! to live pleaſurably, and grow rich! 'Tis true, there are many <hi>Traders,</hi> who live in much Eaſe and Plenty, and make a very handſome Figure in the World, and 'tis but fit there ſhould be ſuch: <hi>Trade</hi> is the Support and Ornament of Kingdoms, and no Man of ſenſe will any more envy the Man of <hi>Trade</hi> his Wealth, than the Man of the Sword his Honour, or the Man of Letters and Abilities his Places and Preferments: But if I could, I would have Men grow up to all theſe by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39250:56"/>
and Induſtry, by an Apprentiſhip of Sobriety and Vertue; I would have Enjoyment be the Reward of Merit; I would not have Eaſe and Pleaſure be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed by the looſe and unworthy, but regularly poſſeſſed by ſuch as have taken pains to purchaſe both, and have Senſe, Experience, and Vertue enough to enjoy them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Trader</hi> muſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Calling. Pride and Vanity are generally ſworn Enemies, both to the Content and Proſperity of Traders, but then it muſt be remembred ſome are but lightly tinged, others more thoroughly and deeply died with theſe Vices; in ſome they produce only little Comical Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and almoſt Innocent Excurſions; but in others very fatal Diſorders and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities. There is no gracefulneſs in any Motion that is not natural; a Man of low Stature may add ſomething to his Height, but nothing to his Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, by ſtrutting upon Stilts. Nor is there only an ungracefulneſs, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs in all affected Motions; we are all a little purblind and dimſighted in this World, and therefore walk more ſecurely in the ways we are acquainted
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:39250:56"/>
with; but for my part, when an Error is only Comical, and expoſes Men no further than to a little Rallary and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, 'tis ſcarce worth my while to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to it; and I cannot tell whether it be worth every Man's while to be at the Charge of Correcting a Humour, which if it do a little expoſe him, does yet pleaſe him too; the Pride and Ambition which I would extirpate, is ſuch a one as I have obſerved fatal to the <hi>Trades-man</hi>'s Fortune and Repoſe; ſuch as tempts him to deſpiſe and neglect his Trade, or puts him upon Expences which it cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or ingages him in bold or hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Projects; this is an Error which I would fain reform, and methinks a few ſober Reflections ſhould here prevail: What? Can it be ſenſe to make a ſhow abroad at the Expence of your Content and Peace at home? What? is it not much better to be modeſt, and ſafe, to be humble and at eaſe, than to ſuffer daily anxieties and perplexities, and to have your Mind always upon the rack, how to anſwer and ſatisfie the Importunities of Pride and Vanity? 'Tis worſe yet, when a ſhort piece of Pageantry ends in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Infamy, when this impotent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:39250:57"/>
is nouriſhed by Robbery and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, by Fraud and Cheat committed upon Widows and Orphans, Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friends, and the neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I muſt confeſs, I am amazed to think that any ones Pride ſhould be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a falſe and fatal Grandure, upheld only by Wrong and Injuſtice, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a moment into endelible ſhame and unretrivable ruin. For my part, I ſhould in this caſe look upon Bravery, not as the Marks of Greatneſs, but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of a Sacrifice; not as the pomp of a Triumph, but a Funeral; and my luſcious Morſels, how pleaſing ſoever to my Palate, would be ready to riſe and recoile in my Stomach. As to thoſe who ſeem to ſcorn their Profeſſion, I have but this to ſay, Let them find out a more thriving one before they leave the old one, before they deſert the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were bred to for its meanneſs, let them make ſure of a more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Employment, or elſe the ſcorn they load their Trade with, will be want of ſenſe, not greatneſs of Spirit; a lazy Pride, not a generous Ambition; and if ſo, I am ſure there is no Profeſſion ſo mean as that of ſloth and looſneſs.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The ſecond ſort of Rules are ſuch as concern the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Artiſan,</hi> for 'tis to little purpoſe that he thrive in his Secular, if he run out in his Chriſtian Calling, for this is but to be fortunate, and yet miſerable. Therefore,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> He muſt be ſure that his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be lawful.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it be carried on with Truth, Juſtice, and Charity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That his Attendance on the Buſineſs of this World, do not extinguiſh his Concern for a better, and his <hi>Trade</hi> devour his <hi>Religion,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine did the fat ones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he propoſe to himſelf <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>rational Ends</hi> of <hi>Trading.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> He muſt be ſure that his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be lawful; that is, ſuch as is neither forbidden by any Law of God, or the Magiſtrate, nor does in its own Nature miniſter to Vice. But that I may not perplex Mens Minds with unneceſſary Scruples, and tempt them to doubt of the lawfulneſs of all <hi>Trades,</hi> that are any way made the Inſtruments of Sin and Folly, you muſt know ſome things mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to ſin directly and neceſſarily, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:39250:58"/>
only accidentally, and not by the immediate Intention of the <hi>Artiſt</hi> or <hi>Trader,</hi> but the abuſe of others. The former ſort of Traders are unlawful in themſelves, and no pretence can ſanctifie the uſe of them; he that directly and immediately miniſters to a ſin, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates in the guilt of it, as he that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys for the Luſt of others, partakes of the ſin of the Adulterer and Fornicator; but thoſe which Miniſter not purpoſely and immediately, but accidentally, are yet in themſelves lawful; nor ſhall the Trader communicate in thoſe Abuſes to which the Luſts and Vanities of others proſtitute them: Thus Taverns are not unlawful, becauſe abuſed by Intemperance, nor are all Shops of Clothing to be ſhut, becauſe thence People furniſh themſelves with ſuch things as inflame their Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Pride; the Reaſon is plainly this, becauſe the ſin may be ſeparated from the Trade; that Wine, whoſe full Draughts are by ſome made uſe of to the defacing Reaſon, and enkindling Luſt, may as well refreſh the weary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the moderate; thoſe Garments which adorn the Proud and Wanton, may be made uſe of to add a Luſtre to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:39250:58"/>
The Inconvenience would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable, if every Profeſſion which did but indirectly and caſually adminiſter to Vice, were therefore ſinful, the Courts of Juſtice muſt be laid aſide, becauſe often times the Bar and Bench have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to oppreſs, injure, and rob in form of Law. The Pulpit muſt be for ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, becauſe Men have ſometimes ſown the Seeds of Sedition and Slavery from hence. All the <hi>Arts,</hi> either of War or Peace, have ſometimes ſerved the Cruelty of the one, and Luxury of the other, and by conſequence would be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of all Commonwealths. Yet here it muſt be confeſſed, that the more or leſs tendency any Trade hath to the promoting Vice, it is in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the more or leſs eligible. And that it imports men, who love their <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> more than gain, not to debauch their Callings themſelves, by proſtituting them to Extravigances and Exorbitances, and projecting Profit from the Intemperances and Sins, that is, the Ruin of others; for 'tis not ſufficient to the Peace and Comfort of a Man's Mind that his Calling be innocent, if his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of it be not ſo to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:39250:59"/>
                        <hi>Secondly, Trade</hi> ought to be managed with <hi>Truth, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> for without theſe 'tis only a more cleanly Art of Cheating or Oppreſſion; Sins which I doubt can receive but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or mitigation from the cuſtom and practiſe of them: Without theſe <hi>Trade</hi> cannot be regular and eaſie, nor Gain comfortable and delightful, ſince no man can have any Confidence in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, when the Methods of his thriving are ſuch as merit Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not a Bleſſing; nor can I ſee any thing that can betray Men into Lying and Knavery, but the want of true Senſe, as well as true Faith, ſince thô many by undue ways have more ſuddenly enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, yet 'tis evident that the Wealth which is more regularly purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is more pleaſant, durable, and laſting; and that honeſt and equitable Dealing is the ſureſt, if not the ſpeedieſt way to Wealth. Nor are there, I believe, many Inſtances of Men, who if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Buſineſs, have ever ſuffered much by their Uprightneſs and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Dealing, it being very hard to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that a <hi>Trader</hi> ſhould be a loſer by thoſe Vertues which advances Credit
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:39250:59"/>
and Reputation: But however this be, I am not now inquiring after Wealth, but <hi>Happineſs,</hi> to the obtainment of which I am very poſitive that the obſervation of theſe Meaſures, is indiſpenſible, ſince the contrary muſt needs pervert the Mind, and intangle Life; and as they extinguiſh in the Soul all Sparks of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and Greatneſs, ſo muſt they its Courage and Confidence, Tranquility and Peace, which can reſult from nothing but the due Moderation of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Conſcience of our Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Traders</hi> Attendance on his Calling muſt not diſcharge him from his attendance on <hi>Religion,</hi> 'Tis true, 'tis commonly ſaid and generally admitted, that the duty of every ones Secular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a part of <hi>Religion,</hi> but this ought to be well underſtood, that ſo neither a Veneration for Religion breed a neglect of your Callings, nor an over-fond O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Merit of Induſtry in your Calling, as if all Vertue were compriſed in it, breed a Contempt of Religion; 'tis fit therefore to put you in mind, that Arts and Trades have not in themſelves any direct or immediate tendency, either
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39250:60"/>
to the improvement of Reaſon, or the production of Vertue, they miniſter to the Neceſſities of this World, not the Glories of another; nor are they ſo much the Works of a Rational and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as of a Mortal and Indigent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from whence it follows, that thô they are neceſſary to the preſent ſtate of things, yet can they deſerve to imploy you no longer than either the publick Benefit or private Convenience require it, and that you are then only wiſely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about theſe, when neither your Endowments nor Fortunes capacitate you for a Life more immediately and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to the purpoſes of Reaſon and Revelation; and finally, that the Works of a Secular Profeſſion are then only acceptable Sacrifices to God, when conſecrated by wiſe Principles and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues cleaving to and mingling with them. Do not therefore think that a Pretence of Buſineſs can Cancel your Obligations to the Duties of Chriſtianity. If a Man could fancy, which I never can, Buſineſs and Religion incompatible, 'tis evident which were to be preferred, ſince if the will of God were ſo, it is much better to be ſtarved than to be damned; But
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39250:60"/>
without carrying the matter ſo far, 'tis plain that Vertue and <hi>Religion,</hi> with a competency, render Men abundantly more happy than Wealth can do, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the neglect or contempt of either; 'tis the riches of the Mind makes men great and happy; the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and irreligious can never be either. Let no man therefore think that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers any Damage, if he be forced to maintain his Vertue and Religion by the diminution of his <hi>Trade,</hi> thô I cannot comprehend that there can be a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this; for I have never yet obſerved any Man ſo oppreſſed and over-charged with Buſineſs, as not to find time for Pleaſure, when he has pretended he could find none for Religion. In a word, the neglect of Religion is capable of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, not only becauſe your future, but preſent happineſs depends upon it; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty or Moderation to curb a vain and ambitious thirſt of Wealth; Faith or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Providence of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you from mean, baſe, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Courſes; Self-reſignation to prevent anxiety, and thoſe fears to which the Uncertainties, Changes, and Revolutions of Times and Trades make Men ſubject,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39250:61"/>
ſeem to me as neceſſary to the Peace and Happineſs of a <hi>Trader,</hi> as a competent Stock, Induſtry, or Skill can be to his Worldly Succeſs or Proſperity; and thô Men, who allow themſelves no time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Attendance upon Publick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or Private Meditation, may talk finely of theſe Vertues by way of Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Speculation; It is impoſſible they ſhould be really poſſeſſed of them; <hi>How can he get Wiſdom that holdeth the Plough, and that glorieth in the goad that driveth Oxen, and is occupied in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and whoſe talk is of Bullocks?</hi> which the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> by a parity of Reaſon, extends further to all <hi>Traders</hi> and <hi>Artiſans,</hi> who are in like manner wholly taken up in their Art. I could therefore wiſh that thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul,</hi> were writ in Capital Letters in the moſt conſpicuous place of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Houſe, and the Shop, that you might ever and anon be put in mind, that there is one thing more neceſſary, even than the diligent and proſperous management of your Trade, namely Religion; for to what purpoſe is it that your Books are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:39250:61"/>
well kept, that there is order and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the whole Conduct of your Trades, if at the ſame time your neglected Hearts lye like the Field of the Slugga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> waſte and open, and over-grown with Briers and Thorns and Weeds; or like a confuſed and intangled Stock of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unskilful Trader, which waſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays each day? To what purpoſe is it that you be punctual Dealers towards Men, if you be Bankrupts towards God? To what purpoſe is it that you have Credit and <hi>Honour</hi> upon the Change, if you be poor and beggarly, ſhameful and ſneaking in your ſelves within, having your Souls deſtitute of any true Peace, Wealth, or Courage, and you ſhift the Accuſations and Importunities of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as much as a wretched Debtor would a ſevere and inexorable Creditor? Ah! while you purſue the World, forget not that there is a Heaven; and while you make Proviſion for Time, make ſome to for Eternity; let your ſtating your Accompts with Men, put you in mind of clearing your Accompts with God; and let theſe two things never be out of your thoughts, firſt, That it is God who gives Man power to get Wealth; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:39250:62"/>
next, That 'tis not a clear Eſtate, but a clear Soul that makes Man happy, I mean a Soul freed from ſilly and vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and enriched with a Knowledge and Love of God and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Trader</hi> muſt propoſe to himſelf proper and rational Ends of <hi>Trading.</hi> For whoever propoſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vain and falſe ones, will entangle his Life in manifold Troubles and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and loſe his <hi>Reaſon, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Tranquility</hi> in the Windings and Mazes of wretched Fancies, and unaccountable Projects. Theſe <hi>Ends</hi> of Trading I take to be theſe Three: <hi>Firſt,</hi> A compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and honeſt Support of your Selves and Families. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A charitable Succour and Relief of others. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A timely Retreat from a Secular Calling to a Contemplative Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> A competent and honeſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of your ſelves and Families. This end is pointed out by the Apoſtle, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.14. and called <hi>neceſſary uſes; i. e.</hi> we muſt deſign in <hi>Trade</hi> the ſupport of the Neceſſities, not Luſts of Nature. And were not all <hi>Trades</hi> over-ſtocked, and conſequently the obſervation ſuperfluous, I ſhould tell you that publick, as well as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39250:62"/>
private Neceſſities, were here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Nor is your Care here limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your own Neceſſities only, but thoſe alſo of your Children and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty demand their ſhare in it; but then, leaſt under this pretence you extend your Deſires beyond all Bounds, you are to remember, that in reſolving the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Proviſion, you are not to take Counſel of your own Ambition, or the wanton Expectations of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that Proviſion for them is wiſeſt which lays a ſufficient Foundation for their Induſtry to build on, and leaves them under an Obligation to Buſineſs and Employment. And is not this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? To what purpoſe ſhould Men toil, cark, and pinch to make their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies rich and great, that is lazy and wanton, to leave behind them an Eſtate which their own Example proves more than neceſſary, for moſt of thoſe that do ſo, have made little uſe of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Miſtake me not, I do not think it unlawful to be rich, or to leave ones Family ſo; but I think it fooliſh and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful too, to ſacrifice the Peace of ones Mind, and the Eaſe of ones Life, to the Luſt of Riches: I think it ſilly and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39250:63"/>
to raiſe a Family by meanneſs and ſordidneſs, or to lay the Foundation of Childrens Greatneſs in ones own Infamy. In ſhort, 'tis not Wealth, but an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Paſſion for it which I condemn. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is the Gift of God, a common Reward of Chriſtian Vertues; for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is ſaid to <hi>have the Promiſes of this Life, and that which is to come.</hi> Wealth then may be received, but it muſt not be deſigned as your firſt and chief End. Thus <hi>Fame, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are great Bleſſings and Favours of Heaven, but whoever immoderately thirſts after the one or the other, is ambitious and vain glorious. You may receive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things with Gratitude, and enjoy them with Moderation, but if you doat upon them, you violate the Vow of your Baptiſm, and virtually renounce your Faith; for would not this be to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that Heaven were your Kingdom and Country, and Earth the place of your <hi>Exile,</hi> or at beſt Pilgrimage? This is a Leſſon can never be too often inculcated, not only on the account of that violent Oppoſition 'tis almoſt every where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with, but alſo the vaſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance 'tis of, to the quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39250:63"/>
of a Trading Life, this one thing is the Philoſophy, the Trader ſhould be ever ſtudying, the Wiſdom he ſhould be daily purſuing, that is, a true and juſt Moderation of his Deſires of Wealth. Did Man know how to bound his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by the Neceſſities or Conveniences of Humane Life? Could he regulate his Appetites by the modeſty and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity, not by cuſtom and fancy? I am confident this one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would reſcue him from the far greater part of Evils and Incumbrances which infeſt Humane Life, Vanity, and Ambition, Envy and Emulation, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Fancy, create moſt of theſe Difficulties and Neceſſities which ſtain the Beauty, diſturb the Peace and Order, and deſtroy the Pleaſure of Life. When Mens Deſires and Aims are too big for their Callings, they are unavoidably plunged into Diſcontent and doubtful Projects; and if they ſink not finally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ruin, they cannot be held up but by ſuch an anxious and reſtleſs Proſecution of the World, as looks rather like Hurry or Diſtraction, than <hi>Trade</hi> or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I can therefore never think a <hi>Trades-man</hi> happy, till he has modeſty
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:39250:64"/>
enough to find content in the Revenue of a moderate and eaſie Trade; till he underſtands what are the Bounds his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and his Station ſets him; and thô he know how to enjoy a great Fortune, does never want one; has Senſe enough to uſe it, and Vertue enough not to let his Happineſs depend upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> A charitable Succour and Relief of others. 'Tis confeſſed by all, that Men are born, not for themſelves only, but for others too; and God, the Diſpenſer of Temporal Wealth, commands ſuch as are rich in this World, to be rich in good Works too; but it is always to be provided, that Juſtice do firſt take place, and then Charity. This Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore ſuppoſes the <hi>Traders</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts to ſtand fair, it ſuppoſes him to have diſcharged the Duties which he owes to his Relatives and Dependants, or elſe to have none. I will not inſiſt on the Obligation or Pleaſure of Charity; I will not preſs you to it by the Intereſt of your preſent or future <hi>Happineſs;</hi> for the truth is, to do right to the <hi>Trading</hi> World, there is no rank or order of Men in the Kingdom, that is more ſenſible of the Duty of Charity, or more inclined
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:39250:64"/>
and diſpoſed to it, none that give more eminent Proofs of it while living, or leave more glorious Monuments of it behind them. One thing only I will take upon me to recommend to you, that is, the Advice of <hi>Solomon; Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave whether thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;</hi> that is, what ever Good you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do, do it ſpeedily, and as much as in you lies, be your own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. How often are excellent Purpoſes ſtrangled in the Birth by an unexpected Death? How frequently are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the corruption and negligence of thoſe to whoſe inſpection they are committed? Beſides, this way, you ſhall reap the Fruit of your own Plantations, you will enjoy the Pleaſure and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction reſulting from the Perfection, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and good Contrivance of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations you have laid, or you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupply the Defects, or correct the Errors of your Model, and prevent thoſe future Miſcarriages which ſuch Deſigns are liable to. Thô all this be very much, yet it is but the leaſt part of what you will reap from being your ſelves the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:39250:65"/>
of your own Bounty, you will be ſure that you dedicate it to Charity, not to Vanity, that you are building Almes-houſes for the Living, not Tombs and Pyramids for the Dead; you will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape that common Cheat and Impoſture the Rich put upon themſelves, while they entangled themſelves in Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all their Lives, under pretence of deſigning mighty things after Death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Trades-man</hi> ought to propoſe to himſelf a timely Retreat, <hi>i. e.</hi> if the Neceſſities of this indigent State will give way to it; which ſeems to me natural to finiſh Buſineſs e're we finiſh Life; to lay down our Burden ere we tire and fall under the weight of it, and quit troubleſome Employments, before our bungling diſcharge of them proclaim the decay of our parts and ſtrength, and the increaſe of our Avarice and Ambition: Nay, the very continuance of the ſame Cares for the World, which looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like Prudence, will in old Age be reckoned Sin and Folly: To Trade, is but to make Proviſion for Life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince common Senſe will tell us that we muſt not be always providing for Life, and never live: 'Tis plain Men ought,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:39250:65"/>
if they may, at length break off their Trade, or at leaſt ſo contract it, that it may be rather Diverſion than Travel; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends us to the Ants to learn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, ſo might he learn Wiſdom too, the Enjoyment of their Treaſure in the Winter being no leſs an Inſtance of the one, than their Labour in laying it up in the Summer of the other. Beſides, in ripe years, the Advice of the Prophet ſeems to be addreſſed to every Man, <hi>Set thy Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt ſurely dye, and not live; i. e.</hi> ſtate your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, ſettle your Fortune, compoſe the Differences of your Family, and fix your Children, ſo that you may be able to diſcern what courſe they will ſtear when you are gone, and to correct any Error they are apt to fall into, while you live, which may otherwiſe, when you are dead, prove incorrigible and deſtructive. If theſe Motives, taken from Decency, Prudence, and Mortality, ſeem too light, there is another of more weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment behind, that is, the conſideration of your Eternal Intereſt. 'Tis highly neceſſary to leave the World before you be torn from it, and to acquaint your ſelves more familiarly with another
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:39250:66"/>
World, before you paſs into it to make your aboad in it for ever. Certainly it requires ſome time to prepare the Soul for Death and Judgment; and that Man will be very unfit for either, who is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Counter to the Grave, and from the Intanglements of Secular Cares to the Tribunal of God. But beſides the Benefits which you will find in Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Proſpect and Propoſal of it has many in it; the hopes of a Sabatick year in Life, will eaſe the weight and travel of thoſe that precede it, and a deſign of of Retreating from Trade and Buſineſs will be apt to induce Men to paſs their firſt years with more Moderation and Abſtinence, that they may the ſooner provide the means of an eaſie or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Retirement.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Rules well obſerved would free the Negotiating Life from all the great Evils and Inconveniences it is ſubject to. Buſineſs, as it was in the time of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, would be, not the Curſe, but the Bleſſing of Mankind; and Trade would be as eaſie and innocent, if not as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Husbandry in his Garden; for thus Induſtry would be without Drudgery, and Care without Anxiety;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39250:66"/>
Commerce would be carried on without any mean or ill Artifice, without impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and tormenting Deſigns, or tireſome and vexatious Diſappoinments. What need would there be of Shifts and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, of Fraud and Circumvention, if a Man had Faith enough to believe that God's Bleſſing upon his Induſtry were the only way to grow truly rich, I mean to get, if not ſo much as he would, yet as much as would be good for him? What Temptation would Man lye under to Bondage and Drudgery, or to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and Anxiety, if he could contain his Deſires within thoſe narrow Bounds which Nature and his Station have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him? What Fears could diſquiet the Mind, which were formed into an intire Reſignation to and Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God? Or how could the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare that Soul which allots a proper time for Publick Religion, and Private Meditation? In one word, theſe Rules being followed, Men would not only avoid the common Rocks on which the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fortune of the <hi>Trader</hi> generally daſhes, but alſo attain the end of this ſort of Active Life, they would get E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in their younger years, and enjoy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39250:67"/>
them in their riper; nay, no portion of Life would want its proper and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enjoyments, they would in the midſt of Buſineſs preſerve their Innocence, and when they did retire from it, they would perfect that Religion which they could before but begin, and enrich and adorn and entertain the Soul, which they could but guard and defend before, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain in Life, I mean Spiritual Life.</p>

                     <p>THE firſt thing that offered it ſelf to my thoughts, taking a view of this Subject, was, the Collegiate Life of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39250:68"/>
Scholars in the Univerſities; but beſides that here they do not ſo much deſign to retire from the World, as to prepare themſelves for it; I had reaſon to think, whatever Service I could propoſe to do the Publick by any Advice I could here offer, my Zeal would never be able to attone my Preſumption, ſince theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of Learning, are under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Direction of the Ableſt, not of this Age only, but of thoſe paſſed: I do not therefore Calculate this Diſcourſe for theſe, but for Perſons of another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and under no Direction but their own; for ſuch, who make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the World, tired, and ſated with it; for ſuch, whoſe Inclination or Fortune caſts them upon a quiet, private, and unactive Life; To theſe, I offer my ſelf a Companion; I would enter with them into their Privaces, and aſſiſt them to paſs their Hours with true Pleaſure and Innocence; I would inſpire them, if I could, with wiſe and excellent Thoughts; I would ingage them in the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and moſt delightful Buſineſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and guard them againſt thoſe Evils and Follies which are apt to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into the moſt Solitary Life.</p>

                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:39250:68"/>I muſt here in the next place repeat an Obſervation which I think I have ſome where before made, That the Life of Man muſt neither be wholly Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, nor wholly Active; for as Action and Buſineſs, without any Meditation, is apt to alienate the Mind from God and Vertue, to corrupt all that is great and generous, and truly wiſe in it, and wed it wholly to the World; ſo I doubt a Life ſpent wholly in Contemplation, without any mixture of Action, will prove fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unprofitable; and Men condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to utter Solitude, like the Trees and Shrubs of the Wilderneſs, would grow wild and ſavage, luxuriant in Leaves, but their Fruit, if they brought forth any, ſower and ſmall. They forget the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Duty of Man, and talk not Seraphically, but Fantaſtically; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſwade him to give up himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to Contemplation; Man is yet a mixt and compound Being, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all Spirit, let him be all thought: He is yet a Citizen of this World, thô he be deſtined for another; let him not forget that there are Vertues becoming him as ſuch, let him live by intuition, when he comes into the perfect Light,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:39250:69"/>
and enters into the beatifick Preſence, let him live by Raptures, when he is come into a World where Wants and Frailties, Paines and Evils cannot enter: In the mean time, let Man content himſelf with Humane Vertue, and in this low proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary State, not dream of the Flights which only Angels take; having thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care, firſt to raiſe no expectation in my Reader, which might afterwards be fruſtrated; and next prevented his being betrayed into any Extravigance by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a more abſtracted Life, than the Nature of Man and the World will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I will now proceed to Diſcourſe of theſe three things:

Some propoſe to themſelves Eaſe and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the great end and deſign of their Retirement; now thô this be a mean and low Project, little becoming the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, yet I cannot but acknowledge, that it ſeems
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39250:69"/>
to me an abſurd and irrational thing, to wear out Life in a continual hurry or drudgery; and I cannot but think it reaſonable, that Men ſhould one time or other allow eaſe to the Body, and quiet to the Mind; ſhould ſet both free from their Servitude to the World, and enjoy the Wealth which they have got together, and eat the Fruit of their Travel and Care: But thô this be true, yet if Men do quit the Buſineſs, only to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the Pleaſures of the World; if they exchange their Anxiety and Toil for Luxury and Senſuality, and inſtead of being induſtrious, plodding, and thriving Traders, become idle, or which is worſe, looſe and riotous Country Gentlemen; this I muſt confeſs is but a miſerable Change, this is but to prophane Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, abuſe Plenty, and waſte that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time which God has made them Maſters of; this, in a word, is not for a Man to quit his ſlavery, but to exchange his Maſters; for as to the intereſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life, and the true end of this, 'tis much the ſame thing, whether a Man be a Servant to Pleaſure and Sloth, or to Covetouſneſs and Ambition. The ſum of this Matter is plainly this, 'tis undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39250:70"/>
lawful for ſuch as have been long toiled in the purſuit of the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and enjoy themſelves and their Friends; nay further, I count them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who ſeem born not to ſtruggle and contend with the World, but to enjoy it; but if by Enjoyment be here underſtood, only the gratification of the Humour by outward, thô innocent Pleaſures, I muſt affirm, That this is too mean, too low, to be the chief End, either of the ones Entrance into the World, or the others Retreat from it: But if, which is worſe, by <hi>Enjoyment</hi> be here meant growing fat with good Eating and Drinking, or as it were rank and rotten through Eaſe and Sloth, I deny this to be the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of a Man, much leſs of a Philoſopher or Chriſtian: The <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of a private Life or Philoſophical Receſs, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Peace and Order, in Harmony and Exaltation, in a holy Calm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, in which, as in a clear day, from the top of ſome advantageous height, we <hi>Enjoy</hi> an enlarged and delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; when we look backwards, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a wide Sea covered with a vaſt number of all ſorts of Veſſels, toſſed up and down at the mercy of Winds and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39250:70"/>
Waves, ſome few ſeem to make out with a ſteddy Courſe, but are immediately encountered with croſs Winds and Storms, a very few indeed to return in triumph homewards, and of theſe ſome miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying almoſt in ſight of Port; of all the reſt, a great part, with much toil and difficulty, do ſcarcely live in ſtreſs of Seas and Weather, but the far greater part do ſuffer wrack, and ſcatter their miſerable Ruins on every Coaſt. But when we look forward, we diſcover a rich and ſecure Country, thinly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted indeed, but filled with all the Marks of Joy and Victory. But whither will my Imagination lead me; the Enjoyment of the retired, is to conſiſt in the pleaſant Reflections they make on their Eſcape out of a tempeſtious World, in the Commerce and Entercourſe they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with that above; in a calm and leaſurely ſurvey of all the various and wonderous Works of God, the Worlds of Grace and Nature; and laſtly, in a very intimate and familiar Acquaintance with themſelves, and the daily habitual practiſe of pleaſing and perfect Vertues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> One true end of <hi>Retirement</hi> may be Self-defence, or Preſervation.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:39250:71"/>
An Active Life is a ſtate of War, and the World is an Hoſtile Country, Snares and Ambuſhes are laid every where for us, and ever and anon Temptations, worldly and fleſhly Luſts, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us do <hi>war against the Soul,</hi> do indeavour either to court and betray us, or to drive and force us into death and ruin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we be conſcious to our ſelves of our own weakneſs, we have reaſon not to expoſe our ſelves to dangers, which we have not courage nor ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vanquiſh; and to chooſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement not as a ſtate of Perfection, but Safety, the Meaſures of Grace, the Strengths of Reaſon, and the Inclinations of Nature, are very different in different Men; whoever therefore, upon the beſt ſurvey he can make of his own Forces, and after ſome, not inſincere Trials, finds himſelf no Match for the World, unable to countermine its Policies, and oppoſe its Power, ſuch a one, if he can, may, nay, I believe ought retire from the World, as from the face of a too potent Enemy; for thô War be fuller of Glory, Peace is of Security; and thô an active and buſie Life be in its ſelf more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the good of Mankind, and the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39250:71"/>
honour of God, yet in this caſe, a poor Chriſtian may prefer a Contemplative one as the ſecurer; and this is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Service of God and Man, but Sin and Danger; 'tis not to prefer Eaſe and Security before Spiritual Induſtry and Glory, but before a raſh Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a fatal Defeat or Overthrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another End of Retirement may be, to render us more beneficial to the World. The different Talents of different Perſons do ſeem to mark them out, and deſtine them to different ſorts of Life; there are, if I may ſo ſpeak, Active and Contemplative Gifts, and 'tis a great Felicity for any one to be able to know himſelf ſo well, as to diſcern what the God of Nature has deſigned him for: Some, who are a diſgrace to a publick Station, would be an Ornament to a private one; many who act but awkwardly, think and meditate very wiſely and accurately; and ſome, who do but expoſe themſelves in Buſineſs, would paſs very well in Retirement, and prove excellent Examples of Innocence and Vertue, and wonderfully obliege by their good Nature, Sweetneſs, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all ſuch as ſhould live within the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39250:72"/>
reach of their Influence. None are wont more earneſtly to covet Retirement, than ſuch who are naturally adicted to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Men too plain, or too great for a crafty add ſubtle World, too generous, tender, and eaſie for a buſtling, vexatious and ſtingy one; theſe are the Men, who when they are Maſters of their wiſhes, ſeem more particularly obliged to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves to ſome eminent Service of the Publick; theſe muſt not bury their Talents, but righten them in quiet and retirement, like Guardian-Angels, they ſhould procure the honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Palaces which they ſeldom or never appear to, and withdrawing only, not to avoid the Service, but the Foolery of the World, they muſt ever maintain an Active Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for thoſe they leave behind caught and entangled in it, and muſt out of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude travel to obtain ſome Bleſſing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon that Government, to whoſe Protection they owe the Comforts and Security of their Retreat. But thô this Direction do more immediately concern ſuch as theſe, that is, Men of Parts, yet ſure there are none utterly exempt from this Obligation of procuring the Publick
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39250:72"/>
Good in their Proportion; who is there ſo deſtitute of the Gifts of Grace, Nature, or Fortune, as to have no Mite to caſt into the Publick Treaſury? He that dares not pretend to attempt the enlightning or reforming the World, can yet adviſe and comfort his ignorant or afflicted Neighbour; he who cannot give Advice at all, may yet give Alms, which very often is as ſolid and ſubſtantial a benefit; and he that cannot do this, can yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be excuſed from Offering up daily Prayers for the Peace and Welfare of his Country, for the Preſervation and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, for the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay he may proceed to what Particularities he ſhall ſee fit or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both in his Petitions and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and from theſe Interceſſions both the Publick and Private, may, for ought I know, reap more true and valuable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, than from the Works and Labours of the Learned, or from the Alms and Bounty of the Rich. To conclude, he that leads the moſt private and ſequeſtred Life, and is too of the pooreſt Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can yet never be ſuppoſed utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of rendring any the leaſt Service to others, ſince the ſingle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39250:73"/>
of Vertue and Integrity, and the warmth of a pious and edifying Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is of the greateſt uſe. Some way or other therefore the moſt ſolitary Life ought to ſerve the Publick, that ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement may not miniſter to Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sloth, but Piety and Vertue, and the World may not loſe a Member, but enjoy its Service in its proper place, and moſt effectual manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The main End of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the World ſhould be, I think, to dedicate our ſelves more intirely to God. The Philoſopher thought indeed a Contemplative Life the moſt happy one, but thought it too a Bleſſing too great for Mortal Man, too high for this frail Nature, and above the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this World; he had a great deal of Reaſon on his ſide, yet muſt we preſs on towards that perfection which we cannot attain; and it is a ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for our doing ſo, that we ſhall thus approach nearer to it; thô therefore what ſome Monkiſh Authors have writ of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Life, equalling almoſt the Duties and Pleaſures of it, to thoſe of an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical one, thô this, I ſay, may ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Romance and Enthuſiaſm, than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39250:73"/>
grave and ſound Doctrine, yet ſure it cannot be denied, but that the Prophets, the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> and the <hi>Eſſens</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many devout and excellent Perſons amongſt the Chriſtians, as well in the pureſt as corrupteſt Ages of the Church, have choſe and coveted Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Deſarts, I mean not uninhabited Places, for that if it were ſo, was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Extravigance, but calm and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Retreats from the noiſe and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from the hurry and diſtraction of much Buſineſs and much Acquaintance; and ſince they did ſo, their Examples ſeems to teach us, That this State may be made eminently uſeful to our own good, and God's glory; here a Man ſeems to have little elſe to do, but to praiſe God and improve himſelf, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the Errors of his paſt Life, and to correct and ſubdue whatever he feels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in himſelf at preſent, to perfect and augment his Graces, and to dreſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn his Soul for the Feſtival Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Triumph of another World: Now he ſeems to have nothing to do but to begin his Halelujahs, to advance into the Borders and Confines of Heaven by Faith and Devotion, and from the heights
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39250:74"/>
of Meditation, to ſurvey as from the next advantageous Hill, the Riches and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that <hi>Canaan</hi> which he ſhall in a moment enter into; and by this method, no doubt of it, as he ſhall enlarge his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and Capacity of Happineſs, ſo ſhall he enlarge his ſhare in it; by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he ſhall adorn Religion, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to the World as moſt lovely and moſt uſeful; he ſhall experiment it to be unſpeakably delightful in it ſelf; he ſhall render the World more eaſie to him, and Heaven more deſirable; and when he comes to the Banks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that is, of Death, which parts this World from the other, he ſhall find the Streams of it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to make him way; that is, the Troubles and Terrors of it diſſipated, and he ſhall paſs through it full of humble Gratitude for the Bleſſings of this paſt Life, and raviſhing Hopes and Deſires of thoſe of the future.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the proper and rational Ends of withdrawing from the World, thô I am not ignorant that there may be ſeveral other Inducements to it; ſuch are the digeſting a Diſcontent or Diſgrace, the curing ſome Paſſion which would be otherwiſe nouriſhed by converſing with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39250:74"/>
its Object, and the meer eſcaping from the Troubles and Noiſe of the World; and as ſome Men are forced out of their Retreats into the World, not without great Service to the Publick, ſo are there others, who if they had ſenſe enough to know themſelves, or modeſty enough to hear the Advice of their Friends, ſhould betake themſelves to a private Life, to prevent the Miſchiefs in which they are like to involve themſelves and others in a Publick one; ſuch are Men of bold and enterprizing Tempers, without Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Men of Zeal and Activity, without Underſtanding. But I deſigned not here ſo much to conſider what might induce Men to embrace a quiet ſilent Life, as what Ends they were to propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they were in it, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, I will paſs on to the ſecond thing.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> A plentiful Fortune. 'Tis true, that a Competency is ſufficient to render a retired Life eaſie, and when any one betakes himſelf to it as a Refuge or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, againſt the Hoſtilities and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Temptations, this is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough; but where a Contemplative Life is a matter of Choice, not Neceſſity, a plentiful Fortune is of great uſe, and a great Ornament; it will make the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Man's Vertue ſhine with a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Luſtre and greater Authority; it will enable him to do many Works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſhall have much delight in them, without Toil or Diſturbance; it will furniſh him with all uſeful means of Publick and Private Devotion, and with whatever is neceſſary to enable him to paſs his time both delightfully and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally. I think I have expreſſed my thoughts clearly; but to prevent all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, I will add, by a plentiful Fortune I do not mean a great one, this is more commonly burdenſome, than uſeful to a private Life, and more apt to incumber it, than promote the true Ends of it. In my Retirement, I would have decency
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39250:75"/>
and order, but not ſtate and ſhow; I would have comely Plenty, but not a toilſom Affluence; for the Buſineſs of Solitude is to raiſe the Mind, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and enſlave it: But the meaſures of this Wealth muſt finally be determined by every Man's own Boſom; for it ought to be proportioned to the Temper and Genius, to the Capacities and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Perſon who retires, and to the more immediate Deſign and Ends of his Retirement; and after all, there is no greater ſtreſs to be laid upon this Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication than this, It is convenient, but not eſſential; thô a wiſe Man may make an excellent uſe of it, it is not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary, but that he may be happy without it, both in Publick and Private. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Pleaſure and Succeſs of Retirement depends much more upon a Man's Temper and Genius, that it be calm and quiet, that it be meek and humble; and if it be not naturally ſo, it muſt be made ſo; for a proud and ambitious, a reſtleſs and turbulent Perſon, will in vain ſeek for that reſt and repoſe in ſequeſtring himſelf from the World, which is to be found only in the ſubduing his Paſſions,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:39250:76"/>
and reforming his Nature: He that is fond of Opinion and Eſteem, he that is at the diſpoſal of Fancy and Humor, and is not able to ſhake off the Yoak of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions and Cuſtoms, will find much to torment him, but nothing to improve or delight him in his Retirement: But on the other hand, the meek and humble Man will find his Garden a Paradiſe, and his Solitude a converſing with God and Heaven; he will enjoy the preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further Proſpect or Ambition; Meditate without any Diſtraction; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Praiſe God, as if he had no other Buſineſs, or Deſign, and do all the Good he can in his little Sphere, as if it were the only Pleaſure and Entertainment of the Life he had choſe. 'Tis one of the great Priviledges of Retirement, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to neglect fantaſtick and imaginary Good, and purſue after that only which is ſolid and ſubſtantial; to be the Maſters of our own Time and Actions, and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Life by our own Reaſon and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not the Fancies and Humors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 'Tis the great Advantage of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, that a Man has all the Pleaſure his Soul deſires within his own reach, that all of the World that is grateful to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39250:76"/>
him, is to be found within the verge of his private Abode; he therefore whoſe Mind gads abroad, and hankers after Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Pleaſures, who is tainted with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or Emulation; who hunts after E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and is diſcompoſed by the Fancy and Cenſures of others, muddies the pure Stream, corrupts and adulterates the true taſt and reliſh of a retired Life; this therefore ought to be the firſt endeavour of him who ſeeks Happineſs in a retreat; to free his Mind from all thoſe buſie or ambitious Paſſions, which will diſturb his Repoſe, and corrupt his Taſte, and to reduce it to its native Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, in which it will be able to reliſh the Bleſſing of true Liberty, of eaſie and innocent Pleaſures, of true and artleſs Friendſhip, of regular and undiſturbed Devotion, and finally, of calm and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Meditation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A good Underſtanding is a neceſſary Qualification for Retirement. It requires no little Prudence to guard our ſelves againſt thoſe Evils or Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences which will be apt to invade, or inſinuate themſelves into our Solitude; decently to decline Buſineſs, Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Cerimonies, Diverſions, I mean
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39250:77"/>
ſuperfluous and unneceſſary, which will rob us of our Time and Liberty, and obſtruct us in all the wiſe Ends we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves, is a matter of no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dexterity and addreſs. Nor does it require leſs Underſtanding to preſerve the Peace and Order of a private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet 'tis in vain to ſhun the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that is abroad, if more fatal and ſtubborn Malledies reign at home. Nay further, the Family of the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Man, ought not only to give him no Diſturbances, but if poſſible, it ought to be moulded and compoſed to his own Humor, and animated by inclinations ſomewhat at leaſt a kin to his. Nay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, let us ſuppoſe the Man ſo intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſequeſted, as to be utterly diſengaged from all other Intereſts but his own, to have no dependance upon any others motion, to have none but himſelf to regard, no other to pleaſe, no other to improve, even here I cannot tell whether ſo abſolute a Liberty do not need the greater Wiſdom to moderate and govern it, and whether it do not require a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Capacity to find a proper and wiſe Employment, for one whoſe Fortune has tied him to none at all; they are no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:39250:77"/>
Endowments which will enable one looſe and free from all Buſineſs, to ſpend his time profitably and pleaſantly; and yet if he do not, he will be liable to the worſt of Evils; he will diſſolve and putrifie in ſloth, or elſe turn ſower and ſavage, churliſh and brutiſh, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, diſguſt, and diſcontent; nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeated with a Life that affords him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, nothing taking: But the Book of Nature lies open to him! 'tis true, but he cannot read it; 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vulgar eye that diſcerns the delicate touches of a skilful Pencil, the curious and ſubtle mixtures of Light and Shade in a well drawn Piece; 'tis not every Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can judge of the beauty, ſtrength, and convenience of a well contrived Building. But his Cabinet may be well furniſhed 'tis true, but if the Man have nothing Bookiſh in him, if he have no Genius for Eloquence, no Ear for the Muſick of Wit and Fancy, no Judgment for Hiſtory, no Comprehenſion for Arts or Sciences, what is a Cabinet to him, thô furniſhed ever ſo well, either for uſe or rarity, 'tis only fit to be ſhown, or to ſleep in, for after all the coſt and skill laid out upon it, the Couch is the beſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:39250:78"/>
Furniture in it. But there is Friendſhip! there is; the Name indeed there is, but the Thing is too Divine; a low and groveling Soul, a dull and impenetrable Temper cannot diſcern the Charms, nor taſte the Sweets of Friendſhip; what is that Familiarity which is incapable of Tenderneſs or Paſſion? what is that Converſation which is incapable of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, or depth, of Wit, or Judgment? But there is Religion, there is Devotion, a boundleſs Field of Profit and Delight! 'tis true; and the Principles of this are plain and ſtrong, able to move the Man of loweſt Capacity to decline Evil, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Calling, and do good in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Senſe and Ability; but as to Seraphick Contemplative Religion, for this to be the Life and Buſineſs of Man, it requires a vaſt Capacity, raiſed and refined Notion, and little leſs than real Enthuſiaſm; I mean a truly Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus or Ardour impreſſed or inkindled in the Soul, by the exuberant influxes of the bleſſed Spirit. In a word, he who in his Retreat is intirely Maſter of himſelf and Time, had need of Talents to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy and divert him to find him Buſineſs and Pleaſure, and to inable him to reap
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:39250:78"/>
benefit from the one, and to preſerve his Innocence in the other; and without this degree of Underſtanding, a ſolitary Life muſt be very dull and barren; nor can I think of any Cure for this, but to increaſe a Man's Task and Buſineſs, in proportion to the defect of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that ſo Imployment may fill thoſe Vacuities which Contemplation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can. This puts me in mind to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance on to the third thing propoſed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to Time. Thô Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more or leſs, ought to enter into every part of our Lives, yet the moſt ſeaſonable time of giving our ſelves more intirely up to it, is the Evening of Life, the Declenſion of our Age; we have then had our fill of the World, and ſhall not be like to hanker after it; we have ſeen the emptineſs of it, and ſhall be more like to fix upon ſolid Good; we ſhall value our Peace and Calm the more, after we have been long toſſed by Storms; beſides, we ſhall ſet our ſelves more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:39250:79"/>
to the Meditation of Death and Judgment, when we are come within Ken of them, and ſhall be apt to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the intrinſick good and evil of things with more impartiality, when the Heats of Youth, and the Boilings of our Paſſions are cooled and ſlak'd: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this is a ſeaſonable time to correct and repair the Errors of the paſt Life, and to ſtate our Accounts for the laſt Audit. But thô I thus prefer Age, as moſt fit for a retired Life, I do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the younger from it, provided it be Vertue, not Softneſs, the love of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, not a cowardly declining the Duties of this, which prompts them to it; otherwiſe, it were ſure much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the younger ſort, through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous ſeaſon of Life, ſhould be engaged and taken up by Buſineſs; nay, ſhould contend even with the Cares, Troubles, and Difficulties of the World, rather than make choice of Retirement to be the Scene of a voluptuous, lazy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Life; for in the one caſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is every day learnt, ſomething done, in the other nothing; in the one, the Man lives neither diſhonourable to himſelf, nor unuſeful to his Country; but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:39250:79"/>
in the other, herots and conſumes away ingloriouſly and unprofitably.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to Place. Solitude has ever been deemed a Friend to Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Retirement from the World very ſerviceable to a Converſation with Heaven: And this Opinion is much ſtrengthened by the practiſe of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerites,</hi> Prophets, and devout Perſons in the beſt times. 'Tis remarked of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that when he would meditate, he went out into the Field; and when <hi>Moſes</hi> met God, it was in the Deſart. Without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, a private Retreat affords us many Conveniences and Advantages to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Life; leiſure and ſilence ſettle and compoſe the Thoughts, and the Mind augments its ſtrength and vigour by reſt, complacency, and collection within it ſelf; and in this ſtate of Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is moſt fit to reflect upon it ſelf, or enter into a ſurvey of the Reſt and Peace of glorified Spirits, and examine the Grounds of its own hopes; by Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we at leaſt in a great meaſure free and diſengage our ſelves from thoſe things which are apt either to ſoften or diſturb us, and to breed in us either Vanity or Vexation. And I cannot tell, but the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39250:80"/>
fineneſs of Air, the openneſs of Proſpect, the Regularity and Moderation of Diet, Reſt, and Exerciſe, may have that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our Bodies, as to diſpoſe and prepare them to be the fitter Inſtruments of the Mind; to all this we may add, that the variety, beauty, and uſe of all the Works of Nature, do inſenſibly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unawares raiſe in us an admiration of the Divine Wiſdom, and invite us to adore his Power and Goodneſs. But all this notwithſtanding, it muſt ever be remembred, that Retirement does not ſo much conſiſt in Solitude of Place, as in freedom from Secular Buſineſs and Troubles, from the Allurements, Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Vexations of the World; if if we put theſe off, we may find Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough in the moſt populous City, but if we carry theſe with us into the Country, we ſhall reap little benefit from change of Place or Air; and under the Name of Retirement, we ſhall be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with all the Evils and Miſchiefs with which Vanity, Diſorder, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction are wont to diſquiet an active and buſie Life: This being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the Nature of our Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to govern us in chooſing the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:39250:80"/>
Place of our Retreat, but eſpecially a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch Duties, wherein we propoſe to ſpend the bigger portion of our Time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Exerciſe and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Contemplative Life is now to be conſidered: And here theſe ſeveral things offer themſelves immediately to my Thoughts, <hi>Buſineſs, Diverſion, Friendſhip, Meditation,</hi> as comprizing all the ſeveral Acts of a Contemplative Life, and meaſuring out the ſeveral Periods of the Aſcetick's time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Of <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> I have before ſaid, That a Life of meer Contemplation, is above the nature and ſtate of Man; and when I conſider how few are capable of any long or regular Contemplations, I am apt to think, that the wiſeſt way for moſt is, not to diſcharge and free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all Temporal Engagements, but only from ſuch as will diſturb the Peace and Order of a retired Life; and yet I could wiſh, that their growth and improvement in Knowledge and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might be their main Buſineſs and Imployment. So many indeed are our Errours and Sins, ſo frail, tender, and weak our Vertue, that to correct the one,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39250:81"/>
and confirm the other, is Buſineſs enough, and may of it ſelf eaſily take up the whole of Life: If we purſue diligently all the Methods of the Improvement and Advancement of Life, we ſhall need no other Arts or Imployments to ſpend or divert our time; he that beſides a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance upon Publick Devotion, Sacraments, and Sermons, beſtows ſome time each day on bewailing his Sins, and bleſſing God for his Mercies; on exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his preſent ſtate, and eſtabliſhing his future hopes; he that ſpends each day but a few Thoughts on God and Jeſus Chriſt his Redeemer, on the vanity and uncertainty of all things in this World, but Religion and Vertue, or finally on Death and Judgment, and withal on the various Arts by which Sin and Folly is wont to cheat or ſurprize him, to tempt or deceive him, will, I believe, find but few hours to waſte; eſpecially when 'tis conſidered how much Time the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Nature, and the Indiſpenſible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we owe to ſome Relatives or other, take up. And this calls to my mind the Vigilance and Induſtry we owe to the Happineſs of others, as well as to our own: There are a great many Offices of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:39250:81"/>
to which Humanity and our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion (if we underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Church-Memberſhip) do oblige us; the Peace of the Neighbourhood, the Preſervation of Laws, the promoting Publick Piety, the Inſtruction of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, the Relief of the Needy, the Comfort of the Afflicted, the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Injured; theſe, and ſuch like Occaſions, will never be wanting to rouze our Zeal, and imploy our Charity; and theſe are Works which will turn to as good, if not a better account in the Life to come, than Solitary Vertue: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they turn to excellent account in this; for when the retired Man doth cultivate the Neighbourhood, and ſow it with his Charity, he ſeems but to plant and water his own Garden, or plough and ſow his own Fields; and while he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them more rich, gay, and fertile, himſelf reaps the Pleaſure and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, enjoys the Proſpect, and feaſts on the Fruit: Juſt ſo it is in this piece of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Husbandry; he who imparts Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Inſtruction to another, purifies and exalts his own Mind; he that ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Expreſſions of his Bounty and Charity, feels his Soul warm and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39250:82"/>
and finds his Vertue and his Joy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; for 'tis with Grace as 'tis with Nature, the Exerciſe of each breeds both ſtrength and pleaſure; to all which you may add, That no Man conſults more effectually the Intereſt and the Pleaſure of his Retirement, than he who moſt zealouſly ſtudies the Support and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Neighbourhood. Here's Buſineſs enough, and I could point out to you more.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould I take pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and cut out Work for the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Man? Peradventure I ſhould do him more Service, could I teach him an Art to decline it. Alas! Buſineſs will hunt and follow us, it will intrude and preſs upon us, whether we will or no; and ſuch is the natural Vanity, ſuch the Curioſity of our Minds, that we are too often apt to make our ſelves work, and to intangle our ſelves in a thouſand Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and Impertinences; I doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is here very needful, to put thoſe I am diſcourſing to in mind, to take care, that whilſt they ſhun the Trouble and Buſineſs of the World, they ſuffer not themſelves to be entangled in Impertinences of their own creating; that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39250:82"/>
they mind and purſue the main End, that is, growth and increaſe in Vertue, and be at all times ready to ſacrifice Trifles and Matters of leſs Moment to this their great Intereſt, leaſt Fancy and Humour, or ſomething worſe, uſurp the place of Reaſon, as it does too often happen, in a Life of abſolute and uncontroulable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, Diverſion.</hi> This is not to be excluded from a Solitary Life; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate Religion, who make it ſower or melancholy, it condemns nothing but what infects the purity, or breaks the force and vigour of the Mind; we are not immortal and incorruptible Beings, the Soul and Body both (for it were vain to contradict univerſal Experience) ſink under the weight of conſtant Labour, it will be hard, if not impoſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the vigour of the Mind, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the health of the Body. God in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World deſigns us Spiritual Bodies, as the moſt proper Inſtruments of theſe active Minds, let us not therefore make them here craſie and ſickly; I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have my Religion be the effect of a broken Body, but an inlightned Mind; I would never have it proceed from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39250:83"/>
conceived againſt this World, but from the firm belief, love, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a better; whatever therefore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion recreates my Mind without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring it, whatever repairs my Body without impairing my Vertue, I embrace with open Arms, I'le not only taſte but drink my fill of Pleaſure, if it exalt not, debaſe my Nature, I ſhall never complain that my Mind is too chearful, or my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too vigorous. Let the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> cut themſelves with Knives and Lancets, I'le keep my Blood and Spirits if I can, to ſupport my Zeal, and enrich my Fancy; and in one word, to ſerve God with Life. No body can here mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, unleſs they do it wilfully, and therefore 'tis not worth the while to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate any wild Objections; I patronize not the Luſt but the Vigour of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; I invite not to the ſenſuality of a polluted Fancy, but to the vertuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of the Mind: And while I think not a dejected and diſcontented Mind, and a decayed Body, the moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice to God, I do by no means deny a penitent contrite Spirit, a purified and obſequious Body to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:39250:83"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Acquaintance and Friends is ever good, but never more proper or neceſſary than here; for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, as it ſignifies ſequeſtring our ſelves from Company, is to be underſtood with diſcretion; and the plain Rule here, as in all other Caſes, is to avoid Extreams, as a Croud, ſo Solitarineſs ſeems not to miniſter, either to the Vertue or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mind, or to the Peace and Calm of Life; the one robs us of our Time, the other leaves us ſo much, that to very many it becomes burdenſome; the one makes us, vain, trifling, or it may be worſe ſenſual, the other dull and ſlow, or it may be moroſe and ſavage. The skill of a Contemplative Man, is not to decline all Company, but provide himſelf of good. The Prophets themſelves had their Colledges; and they in the firſt Times, who left the Cities for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, did yet aſſociate themſelves with one another. Indeed, as I take it, in this kind of Life we have the fulleſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the beſt Service of our Friends, the pureſt Delight, and the trueſt Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, being beſt promoted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Life by Friendſhip; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39250:84"/>
Friendſhip is no more to be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Gardens and Retirements of the Contemplative, than from the Tables and Enjoyments of the Active.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, Devotion.</hi> Participation of the Lord's Supper, and Meditation, are the remaining parts of the Aſcetick Life, and indeed theſe ought to be his great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. A Life in the World may be a Life of Buſineſs, but a retired one ought to be a Life of Prayer, Euchariſt, and Meditation: Nor indeed can it well be otherwiſe, unleſs we have propoſed to our ſelves ſome falſe Ends of Retirement; for theſe are not only the Duties, but the Pleaſures of the Aſcetick Life; in theſe the Soul's enlightned, enlarged, raiſed, raviſhed; in theſe it ſores up to Heaven, and looks down upon Earth; in theſe it poſſeſſes Stability and Security, Peace and Reſt, in the midſt of a frail in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Nature, and a reſtleſs and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous World; in theſe all the Paſſions of the Soul are exerciſed with a moſt tender ſenſible delight, ſorrow, fear, or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Hate and Indignation, do here expreſs themſelves to the height, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any diſorder or torture, but alſo with great contentment and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39250:84"/>
of our Nature; Love, Hope, Joy reign here without either Check or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety. But I forget that theſe Subjects are ſo rich and inexhauſtible, they would engage me endleſly; I forget that they have been treated of ſo often and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently; I will therefore contract my Sails, and yet I think I have ſaid nothing of them, but as they have a particular aſpect upon the Subject of this Chapter, and I cannot paſs over Meditation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making ſome few Reflections upon it: I know 'tis a worn Subject, and therefore, that I may the more eaſily find Pardon, I'le take care that this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Impertinence, if it be one, ſhall be a very ſhort one. I will therefore take the liberty to crowd my Thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Method together, leſt Order and Connection ſhould take up more Paper than the Things themſelves. A <hi>good</hi> beginning is more than half the Work, is a Proverb no where truer than here; for Meditation will be like to end very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, if we enter not upon it in a good Diſpoſition and devout Frame, and if we do, it ſeldom ſucceeds ill.</p>
                     <p>The Soul therefore ought to be ſedate, calm, untouched by any worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39250:85"/>
pure and unſullied by any Carnal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, filled with the deſire of Spiritual Influence, poſſeſſed with the awe of the Divine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Yet may ſudden and extraordinary Acts of Meditation be ingrafted upon the Stock of our Natural Paſſions, however firſt raiſed: Thus a troubled Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it ſelf to reflect upon the Vanity of the World, or upon the Errors of Life and Corruption of Nature, may enlarge it ſelf in a great many very fine, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and edifying Thoughts, till the Storm diſſolve into a ſoft and fruitful Shower. Thus the Mind, a little gay with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or joy, will eaſily overflow into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs, if it enter into the Meditation of the Joys of Heaven, the Love and Beauty of God, the Triumphs of the Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all Meditation we ought to have more regard to Edification than Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to Charity than Knowledge, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Paſſions, than Fancy or Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                     <p>Let none deſpiſe pious Heats and Tranſports, becauſe theſe ſhort Paſſions, often repeated, will grow into habitual Holineſs, and ſteddy Devotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:39250:85"/>Thoſe Arguments which we find moſt effectual to the repreſſing an inordinate Affection, or to the cheriſhing a weak and pining Vertue, are to be often rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; not only that they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready, but alſo becauſe they are generally more ſucceſsful than others, which may yet be in themſelves of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength and force; for Sins, like the Slaves in <hi>Juſtin,</hi> are often more eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by Whips and Scourges, than by Swords.</p>
                     <p>The Principles which do the great Work of Religion, are few, clear and irreſiſtible, but a vaſt Body of Sentences, Notions, Arguments, untried, undigeſted, are like the Armour of <hi>Saul</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> unmanagable and cumberſome.</p>
                     <p>Diſputable or intricate Points do yield little or no Nouriſhment; Wit and Fancy are alſo for Ornament, not Food.</p>
                     <p>Yet weak Stomacks muſt be fed with eaſie and digeſtable Diet; and this may be made too as pleaſant and inviting as it can. God in the Works of Nature has mingled Beauty with Uſe, Pleaſure with Profit, why ſhould we think this unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Kingdom of Grace? Variety alſo may be called in to prevent languor
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39250:86"/>
and drowſineſs; nay, if the Genius of the Man be ſuch, that his Mind is apt to be exalted, and as it were purified by them, I know not why notional and thin, or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and deep Speculations ſhould be forbidden him; only in theſe, and ſuch like Inſtances, two Errors are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided: <hi>First,</hi> That we do not ſtudy more for Delight and Entertainment, than for Edification in Faith and Vertue. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we do not obtrude our Fancies as Oracles, our Dreams as Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith upon the World. If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indulge or abound in both, give me the luxury of Love rather than that of Fancy, and let me excel in Humility and Modeſty rather than Knowledge and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in thoſe few words, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> ſeems to have excellently ſum'd up the whole Doctrine of Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, compriſing at once the Matter, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and End of it, together with the Frame and Diſpoſition of Mind, qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us for it.</p>
                     <p>Writing may ſerve to marſhal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Thoughts, and by this means
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39250:86"/>
we may be ſtocked with Notions which may always be ready Matter and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us to expatiate on; but we ought to take care, that firſt or laſt we be moved or affected by what we write, or elſe this will be rather an Exerciſe of our Invention than Devotion; and all the Products of it will be rather Eſſays of Wit and Fancy than of holy Meditation; and we ſhall be rather apt to be pleaſed with our Parts, than improved by this Practiſe.</p>
                     <p>They who are unable to ſtart proper Matter for Contemplation, or to carry it on regularly and coherently, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence can reap little Fruit by this kind of Exerciſe, may ſupply theſe Defects by Reading, and ſuch Reflections and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it as are moſt eaſily and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly made: For Example, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>And ſeeing the Multitudes, he went up into a Mountain: And when he was ſet, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came unto him. And he opened his Mouth and taught them, ſaying;</hi> O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus! Thou, the true Doctor and Teacher, whoſe Words are Life and Light, Spirit and Truth, I will leave the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I quit the World, and in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Diſciple I approach near thee,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39250:87"/>
O do thou open thy Mouth and ſpeak to me; I deſire not to hear the Voice of the World, or of the Fleſh, or of the Devil; ſpeak <hi>Thou</hi> only to me, ſpeak <hi>Thou</hi> to my Heart and to my Conſcience, and let me hear and feel that Voice that ſpoke Purity to the Leprous, and Life to the Dead, <hi>Bleſſed is the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven, this is a bleſſedneſs indeed! The Kingdoms of the Earth da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle and aſtoniſh me, my Fancy cannot comprehend, my Ambition cannot aſpire after their Grandure and Glory. Ah! what then muſt the Kingdom of Heaven be! But, O my Lord, am I of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe Poor! If I be not, make me ſo; let me be never ſo contemptible to the World, ſo I be approved and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thee; let me have no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Thoughts but for thy Favour, and for the Crown of Righteouſneſs; let me covet no Riches, no Honour, no Power here, if thy Kingdom be but mine in Reverſion, it is abundantly enough! Thus without ſtraining or pumping, Perſons of the loweſt Talents, if they have any Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Religion in them, may be eaſily ſupplied with variety of Argument, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39250:87"/>
with moſt paſſionate and piercing Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>O bleſſed! O voluptuous Life! wherein ſequeſtred from the World, I enjoy all that it has in it of pure, of true, or natural. Ah! that I could once break looſe from thoſe Troubles and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that hang upon me, and enter into thy Peace and Tranquility, I would plunge my ſelf into all thy rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; I would loſe my ſelf to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible World, and forgetting thoſe Shadows and Appearances, and at beſt but faint and weak Reflections of Good, which flutter here about me; I would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon my ſelf intirely to the Joys of the Spirit, and the Elevations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: Let others enjoy Honour, and Wealth, and Power, let me enjoy my ſelf, Truth, and God; let others enjoy the Flatteries of Senſe, and the Cheats of Fancy; give me the health of a ſpritely Mind, the calm and ſerenity of a ſilent Retreat, with the pleaſure and ſecurity which the Divine Preſence breeds in it; let others finally depend on Fortune, me only on my ſelf.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving in the two former Sections, firſt, proved Life to be in its own Nature a ſolid Good, a conſiderable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven; and next, endeavoured to prevent the Abuſes and Miſchiefs to which it is liable, by ſtating the true Notion of Life; and by preſcribing Rules for the right Conduct of the <hi>Active, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>Contemplative Life,</hi> the next thing that naturally falls under Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is, The ſhortneſs and uncertainty of this Bleſſing; this is that that puſsles the Wit, and baffles the Courage of Man, the Rock againſt which all the Attempts of Humane Philoſophy have daſhed and ſplit themſelves; for, to ſay truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Complaints Men make againſt the Troubles, yet have they ever made more and ſharper againſt the ſhortneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:39250:88"/>'Tis true, no Cure has ever yet been found of our Mortality, yet as wiſe Men have ever thought it reaſonable to make the moſt of an Enjoyment, thô it would not come up to all that they could wiſh or fancy, ſo were there no other Life, it would behove us to do with this, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and keep in the flame as long as we can, thô we know it muſt go out at laſt.</p>
               <p>Now Life, like Enjoyment, is capable of Acceſſion or Increaſe two ways, that is, either in its Continuance or Perfection; either by lengthning its Duration, or by raiſing, improving, or as it were ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Joys and Fruits of Life, or Life it ſelf.

                  <p>SOme take Sanctuary in Phyſick, for which they expect at leaſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the health and vigour of Nature, if not the lengthning the Date of Life: I'le not diſpute whether this Art has deſerved ſo well of Mankind, as to juſtifie the Gentiles in enrolling the firſt Authors of it amongſt the Gods, or ſome Chriſtians in attributing its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to Guardian-Angels: I'le not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the poſſibility of that Elixir by which <hi>Artefius</hi> is reported by the <hi>Adepts</hi> to have lived a Thouſand years; nor, what is more to the purpoſe, who have

lived longeſt, whether they who have made moſt, or they who have made leaſt uſe of Phyſick: Or however theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions be reſolved, I am ſure our time is better ſpent in labouring to contemn, than to prevent Death; and that thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Principles which fortifie the Mind, contribute more to the comfort and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Humane Life, than the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Cordials that fortifie the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>Some being willing to conceal thoſe Decays which they could not prevent, and cannot remedy, have deviſed many ways to counterfeit and ſupply that Youth and Beauty which Time and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Accidents have waſhed and worn away. But alas! to what purpoſe is it to deck and varniſh withered Nature, and paint the Spring upon the Face of Winter? What purpoſe is it, when the Evil is incurable, to ſuffer ones ſelf to be flattered and impoſed upon, and try in vain to hide a broaken Fortune, not only from the World, but from ones ſelf? Alas! we muſt feel what we will not ſee; Nature droops and decays as faſt within as it doth without; and we loſe the life and briskneſs of our Blood, as faſt as we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:39250:90"/>
do the elegancy of Feature, or the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs of Complection. In a word, as to this periſhing Body, <hi>Phyſick,</hi> Waſhes, and Fucoſis are in vain; you but paint and patch a ruinous Fabrick, which can never be made ſtrong and beautiful till Death hath taken it quite down to the Ground, and a Reſurrection build it up quite a new. If therefore you would take my Advice, you ſhould lay in a ſtock of ſprightly generous Pleaſures, which may be ever ready at hand to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you when youth and ſtrentgth are paſt; you ſhould take pains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and adorn the Mind, whoſe Beauties will more than ſupply the loſs of thoſe of the Body; Wiſdom, Magnanimity, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Modeſty, Sweetneſs, Humility, are Charms able to recommend a deformed or a decreped Body, and I am confident may be purchaſed at a much cheaper rate, than falſe or counterfeit Beauties are by thoſe who are ſolicitous about them; let then the Morning and Noon of your Life be ſpent in acquiring Vertue, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Knowledge, and good Humor, and in your Evening you'l have no reaſon to complain of the loſs of Youth and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; theſe will be ſolid Riches, and moſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39250:90"/>
amiable Charms, that will provide you both delight and ſupport at home, and command both love and reverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and Time will do you no other injury than it does a Tree, when it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges its Bloſſoms into Fruit; or then it does Statues, Medals and Pictures, whoſe price and value is enhanced by their Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>Convinced that the Decays of Nature cannot be long concealed or propt up, ſome pleaſe themſelves with an Opinion of Surviving in their Poſterity; as if Man by Generation did but multiply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Life did not, like a flame, end with its fuel, but were conveyed and tranſmitted from Father to Son, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, and ſo on; like a Stream that's ſtill the ſame, thô it paſſed through numerous Pipes. Well, for my part, I cannot fool my ſelf with a vain gingle of words; I cannot flatter my ſelf that I ſhall live in him, who probably will in a little time forget me, however he owe his Being and Fortune to me; nay, it may be proud and ungrateful, will wiſh that others did forget me too; like a Stream running, as ſoon as it enlarges it ſelf as far as it can from its little Fountain, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were by its circlings and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,

to conceal the meanneſs of its riſe: I cannot flatter my ſelf, that I can live in them whoſe Hopes and Fears, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Joys, will differ it may be no leſs from mine, whatever they now be, than the Dead do from the Living: Fools that we are, to talk ſo wildly, as if when dead we lived in our Children; do we when living, ſhare in their diſtant Joys? or do our Pulſes beat by their Paſſions? I would not be miſtaken, as if I deſigned to oppoſe or extinguiſh Nature; I know the great Author of it, for wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purpoſes, has implanted in us kind Inclinations towards Poſterity, but then theſe are for the ſake of others, not my ſelf, they ripen into Actions that ſerve the turn of others, not my own; I only bear the Fruit which others muſt gather. And whatever pleaſure I may now feel in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Porſpect of the Honour and Vertue of my Poſterity, 'tis ſuch a one as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> beholding <hi>Canaan</hi> at a diſtance, but ſuch a diſtance that he muſt never enter into it. To conclude, whatever Men promiſe themſelves, I think them tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fortunate, if inſtead of reaping any benefit, when dead, from their Children, their Lives be not ſtained and diſturbed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39250:91"/>
by them; extreamly fortunate if they can make them fit to be their Friends and Favourites, worthy to ſhare their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and able to give them ſome eaſe in their Troubles; thô after all I cannot but think 'tis infinitely more eligible to be the Father of many Good Works, than many Children; to have a Philoſophical Friend or two, than a numerous Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; and to ſpend my time nobly in cultivating my Mind, than in intangling my Life with Cares for thoſe who often will take none for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some have entertained vain Projects of an imaginary Immortality, an Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which they muſt owe neither to God nor Nature, but to Hiſtorians and Poets, Painters and Statuaries, and to the dying Eccho's of a ſurviving Memory; I mean, that which Men ſeek in Poſthumus Fame, in Pictures, and Statues, and Tombs, and embalming Carkaſes; all theſe ſeem to carry in them ſome fading ſhadows of Being and Exiſtence. But ah! how ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary a Life is this; ſomething that does infinitely leſs reſemble Life and Being, than a Dream does Enjoyment? Ah vain ſupport of Humane Frailty! Ah vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Death! If there be any thing in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39250:92"/>
Honour, if it be Body or Subſtance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be ſeen, or felt, or taſted; if it be Reality enough to be any way enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let me poſſeſs it while I live; it comes too late, if it ſerves only to increaſe the Pomps of my Funeral, or to dreſs and ſet off my Sepulchre, or to ſilence the Groans, or to wipe off the Tears of my Orphans, or my Friends, thô this be ſomething: I cannot feel any pleaſure in the foreſight of that Glory, which, while I ſtrain to gaze upon at diſtance, the Fogs and Miſts of Death thicken the Sky; the Voice that will ſpeak me great, will ſpeak me too, Gone and vaniſhed; the Statues and Marbles which adorn my Memory, will adorn my Grave too, and while they expreſs my Image, or my Actions, will proclaim, that all that is now left of me, is Rottenneſs and Aſhes. All this I talk, abſtracting from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of a future Life, for how far the Reputation I leave behind, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my Soul in its ſtate of Separation from the Body, whether the Ecchoes of thoſe Praiſes and Honours beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Memory here, will reach and pleaſe mine Ears in another World, I know not, nor do I much deſire to know;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39250:92"/>
for ſuppoſing ſuch a Life, my Soul muſt needs have nobler Employment, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Pleaſure than this can ever give it: I muſt confeſs, if the Reflections of my Light, when I am ſet and gone, would be of any uſe to direct or inflame Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ſhould now take ſome pleaſure in that, which 'tis hard to perſwade me, I ſhall take any in hereafter; nor would it be a trifling Satisfaction to me, while I lived, if I could believe that my Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or my Friends, could receive any Honour or Patronage from me when dead; and ſince ſome ſort of Character I muſt leave behind, ſince I muſt in this manner, amongſt ſome at leaſt, and for a little time ſurvive, I had much rather leave behind me perfume than ſtench; I had rather live in Panegyrick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, than in Satyrs and Invectives. But after all, how lean and miſerable a Comfort is this? that when I am dead, it will be ſaid, I once lived; and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Croud will talk of me, and of my Actions, what they pleaſe; ſome things good, ſome things bad, ſome things true, ſome things falſe; and what is worſe yet, I muſt ſuffer all the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Humors and Parties in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:39250:93"/>
Ages; theſe muſt give my Abilities and Performances their Character, and the prevailing Faction muſt ſtamp what Eſtimate they pleaſe upon my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>But by all this, I do not mean utterly to condemn the love of Honour, nay, 'tis really to be cheriſhed when it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates rightly, and ſpurs Men on to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and handſom Actions: I love a Charity that is univerſal and boundleſs, and extends it ſelf to follwing Ages; and certainly there is not a nobler Charity, than to furniſh the World with an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that may adorn its own Times, and enkindle the Emulation of Poſterity. Nay further, I am willing to believe, that a gracious God will ſum up amongſt the Accompts of my Life, the influence it has upon the World when I am dead, and to raiſe the Eſtimate of my Vertue, will conſider it not ſimply in it ſelf, but with all the happy Effects which it may any way be the occaſion of in ſucceſſive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; let me then do good, and if I can great Actions, upon any motive, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be juſt and allowable, ſince this will be the bleſſed Fruit of it: But yet it ſhall be my Buſineſs to make ſure of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39250:93"/>
my own Immortality, if that of my <hi>Name</hi> will follow, let it: It ſhall be my Buſineſs to gain the Approbation of God and Angels, and if the Praiſes of this lower World joyn their Harmony and Conſent with that above, this cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige me; I will with all my power make ſure of my Salvation, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Fame: Great and good men have ever felt ſome natural Deſires of this ſort of Immortality: Since then this ſeems to be an Inclination of God's own planting, 'tis not to be extirpated, but rather care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheriſhed and cultivated, and duly pruned and regulated</p>
                  <p>Having exploded thoſe miſtaken Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by which Men ſupport themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhortneſs of Life, I will now proceed to treat of the only two ways by which this Evil may be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure remedied, that is, by prolonging the Date, and by improving and perfecting the Nature and Eſſence of Life, ſo that a Man may live much in a little time.</p>

                     <p>UNder this Article I deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute theſe three Things:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> To refute the Opinion of a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Period of Humane Life. A Fancy which has poſſeſſed the Multitude, and with which the Minds, even of ſuch as would ſeem above it, are not ſeldom aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will conſider what ways the Date of Life may be lengthened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:39250:94"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will remove thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which this Advice is encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, either from the promiſcuous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents hapning alike to Good or Bad, or from the early and immature Death of ſome righteous Perſons. To begin with the firſt of theſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It has been too generally taught and believed, That the Date of Humane Life cannot be protracted, that every particular Man has a fixed and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Period decreed him, beyond which he cannot go. But this Opinion direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeats the force of all Motives and Arguments to Vertue, derived from Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Conſiderations, and undermines our dependence upon God, and redicules our Addreſſes to him, as far as they concern this Life, and the Things of it: And how plain a ſtep is this to the refutation and overthrow of Judaiſm, which was built upon Temporal Promiſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the overthrow of Chriſtianity it ſelf, the Authority of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depending in ſo great a meaſure upon that of the Old, I'le leave every one to gueſs. And were there no other Reaſons to reject this Opinion, beſides theſe alone, theſe I ſhould think were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39250:95"/>
ſufficient, ſince it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any thing ſhould be conſonant to Truth, which is ſo repugnant to the Intereſt and Authority of Religion; but there are ſo many more, that I muſt be forced to croud them together, that I may avoid tediouſneſs and redundancy. This Perſwaſion then is repugnant to all the Inſtincts of our Nature; to what purpoſe is the Love of Life implanted in us by our great Creator? why is Self-preſervation the firſt Dictate and Law of Nature, if all our Care and Diligence can contribute nothing towards it? Vain and impertinent is that Law, whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation can procure us no Good, nor its Violation any Evil. This is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that flatly contradicts the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Obſervation of Mankind in general; how can the Period of Life be fixed and unalterable, which we ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, either lengthened out by Care and Moderation, or ſhortened by Exceſs and Negligence, unleſs we can reſolve to the utter overthrow of Religion, not only that Life and Death, but alſo that Vice and Vertue, Wiſdom and Folly, which lead to the one and the other, are alike predetermined neceſſary and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39250:95"/>
Nor is this Opinion leſs contrary to the Senſe and Reaſon of the Wiſe and Prudent, than to the Experience of the Multitude; Self preſervation is the firſt and chief End of Civil Societies and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law; but how foppiſh and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a thing were it for the Grave and Sagacious part of Mankind to enter into deep Conſultation, to frame ſolemn Laws, and deviſe the ſtrongeſt Obligations to fence and ſecure that Life which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be invaded one minute before its fatal hour, nor prolonged one minute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; nor has Man only, but God himſelf, endeavoured to ſecure this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life by the ſtricteſt and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Laws, nor this only, but he has made Life and Death the Reward of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and Puniſhment of Sin. This Opinion therefore is a manifeſt Calumny againſt the Wiſdom and Sincerity of God; againſt his Wiſdom, if he raiſe up the Pallizado's and Bulwarks of Laws to guard and defend that Life, which can neither be violated before, nor extended beyond its minute: His <hi>Sincerity,</hi> for his Promiſes would be ludicrous and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, and ſo would his Threats too; if neither the Obedience of the Vertuous
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39250:96"/>
could lengthen, nor the diſobedience of the Sinner could ſhorten Life; and in a word, to what purpoſe does the Spirit in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. invite and encourage Men to Religion by the Propoſal of Life and Proſperity, if in the bottom and truth Life and Proſperity depend, not on our Behaviour, but our Fate, and be not diſpenſed according to the open Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, but the ſecret and unconditional, the rigid and inflexible Decrees of the Almighty. I would not ſtop here, but heap together a multitude of other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt this Error, did I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that as it has prevailed too much to be deſpiſed, ſo has it too little to be laboriouſly refuted, and that it has ſo weak a Foundation, that few of thoſe that defend it do believe it, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo heartily, as to ſuffer it to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Influence upon their Counſels or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; Turks, Aſtrologers, and the moſt ſuperſtitious Aſſertors of Fate, being no more free from the Fears of Death, or a Concern for Life, than the reſt of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                     <p>The truth of this Propoſition being thus made out by unanſwerable Reaſons, we are not to ſuffer our ſelves to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:39250:96"/>
by any ſuperſtitious Imaginations, by any obſcure or ſubtle Objections, or by any meer Colours or Appearances of Reaſon, for what is once clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ought to remain firm and unſhaken, thô we cannot unravel every Objection againſt it, therefore thô I ſhould not be able to reconcile this Doctrine with ſome obſcure Texts of Scripture, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of God's Preſcience, and with ſome particular Predictions of Men, who have pretended to read the fatal Periods of Humane Life in the Schemes of Heaven; yet ought its Authority to be preſerved, as built upon plain Texts and ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and atteſted by the Suffrages of the Prudent and Wiſe, and by the daily Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Multitude. But the truth is, there is nothing objected here, but what is capable of a very eaſie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; the Scriptures, which ſpeak an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for Man upon Earth, are not to be underſtood of any particular perſonal Fate, but of a general Law or Rule of Nature, not of the extent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular perſons Life, but of the duration of Man in general, or of the Mortality of our Frame and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſhortneſs of Man's reſidence
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39250:97"/>
here upon Earth; and imply no more than that Man, as well as all other Species of Animals, and indeed of Vegetables, for ſo far <hi>Job</hi> extends the Compariſon, hath his time appointed the Bounds of his Life or Abode here ſet him, beyond which he cannot paſs <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.10. <hi>The days of our Age are threeſcore years and ten, and thô Men be ſo ſtrong that they come to fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength then but labour and ſorrow, ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone.</hi> As to Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Predictions, if the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of them be atteſted by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Authority, and they be not like the Propheſies of Poets, made of mended after the Event, yet methinks, were not the Minds of Men very prone to Superſtition, a thouſand Errors ſhould be ſufficient to diſcredit and diſparage one good Gueſs, and no Man of Senſe ſhould have a value for a pretended Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whoſe Grounds and Principles are evidently uncertain and precarious; no Man of any Religion ſhould be fond of that, which to ſay no worſe of it, ſeems to ſtand condemned by God in Scripture; for thô I muſt not diſſemble this Truth, that the Idolatry which was ever blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:39250:97"/>
with it, ſeems eſpecially to have drawn down a ſevere Sentence upon it, yet can it not be denied, but that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 47. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> 10. and other places of holy Writ ſeem to look upon it with no very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or benign Aſpect. As to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God, I ſee not how the denial of a Fatal Period of Humane Life claſhes with this; on the quite contrary, he ſeems to me injuriouſly to limit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train the knowledge of God, who thinks he foreknows nothing, but becauſe he peremptorily predetermined it; this, if we will ſpeak ſenſe, is to magnifie his Power, but to reduce and confine his Knowledge, or at leaſtwiſe to depreſs and debaſe it, for thus it would not be a prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and eſſential Perfection, but would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from, or depend upon an Arbitrary Will, an unguided Power; for my part, I cannot think it neceſſary, if I could not reconcile God's fore-knowledge with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency in Events, therefore with the <hi>Socinian</hi> to deny the one, or with the <hi>Fataliſt</hi> the other; 'tis enough to me that I learn from Scripture, that is, from God who cannot err, that Preſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Creator, and Contingency to the Creature; the meaſures and bounds
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39250:98"/>
of theſe, if there be any, let who will ſeek, 'tis not my Buſineſs now.</p>
                     <p>But yet, after all this, if any Man will contend for ſuch a kind of Fate as is not rigid and inflexible, but ſubmits to the interpoſal of the Divine Prerogative, and leave ſufficient Encouragement for the Labour, Vertue, and Prayers of Man, I oppoſe it not, Nature has its Laws, but ſuch as God, whenever he pleaſes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules; the Government of Man is not without order and method, much leſs the Government of God; we are born into the World with different Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but yet the unhealthy one may be rectified and mended by Vertue, the healthy corrupted by Vice and Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuch a ſort of Fate or Deſtiny as this that is flexible, and accommodated to the Intereſt of Religion, in which the Evil may be corrected, or the good pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuch a Fate as this, thô the Word be improper, I readily admit, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: No other, I ſay, in the general; for as to thoſe particular Exceptions and Reſervations, which at any time God may, and often does make, from any general Rule or Law, for cauſes always weighty and importent, and generally
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39250:98"/>
hidden and inſcrutable, theſe I meddle not with.</p>
                     <p>Having thus evinced that the Period of Humane Life is not fatally fixed, that no peremptory and unconditional De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, no inſuperable Connection or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catination of Cauſes does ſuperſede our Vigilance and Induſtry for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Bleſſing: I will now proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which way the Date of Life may be lengthened.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>'Tis obvious and manifeſt to every one, that Life depends upon theſe three Things: The cheerfulneſs of the Mind: The health of the Body; And a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Providence of God, by which, as none will deny who admit of Providence, we may at leaſt be protected from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and unlucky Accidents, ſuch as Humane Prudence cannot foreſee. And to theſe three, may, for ought I know, be added, the good will of Man, whoſe Miniſtry and Service is very often of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe to us in this Point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:39250:99"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt thing then I am now to enquire into, is briefly what Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind does contribute to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life, and then more fully, how we may poſſeſs our ſelves of it. 'Tis true, the moroſe and ſour, the froward, the paſſionate, and the ſullen, thoſe ſtains and Blots of Humane Nature do often prolong their Lives to a great Age, as if Nature were renewed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by this kind of Fermentation, or the Blood and Spirits kept ſweet like Water by a perpetual Agitation; but 'tis as true that the looſe and debauched, the intemporate and incontinent do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thô rarely live long, and deſcend into the Grave, rather oppreſſed by their years than their Exceſſes, and if from ſuch extraordinary Inſtances as theſe, we ſhall take the Liberty to form Rules of Life, and to contradict known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Truths, we ſhall ever live at the mercy of Fancy, and never find any ſure and firm footing to reſt upon; I will not therefore doubt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe rare Inſtances, but that the cheerfulneſs of the Mind has a very propitious, its diſcontent a very malign influence, upon the Life of Man; the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39250:99"/>
contentment of the Mind preſerves the Balſom of the Blood, and the Pleaſure of it enlarges the Heart, raiſes the Spirits, actuates and invigorates all our Powers; ſo that when the Mind ſhines ſerene and bright, it ſeems to impart a new warmth, and new life to the Body, a new Spring, and new Verdure to this Earth: On the contrary, a diſeaſed Mind does, as it were, ſcatter its Contagion through the Body; Diſcontent and Melancholy ſours the Blood, and clogs the Spirits, Envy pines away, and Paſſion frets and wears out our ſtrength and life. In few words, there is an intimate conjunction between the Mind and Body; and ſo cloſe is the dependance of the latter upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that the face of inferiour Nature does evidently vary, wither or flouriſh, according to that variety of Weather it makes in the Sky about it, as the Mind ſmiles or lowrs upon it; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we appeal to Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I believe we may ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that generally ſuch live longeſt, who either think very little, or whoſe thoughts are always calm and cheerful; ſuch who are ſtupid, and have no Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or are wiſe and good, and have none
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:39250:100"/>
but ſuch as are regular and delightful; to this purpoſe, in part, is that of <hi>Solomon, The Spirit of Man will ſuſtain his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> All this, I think, is not conteſted; and all the difficulty lies in poſſeſſing our ſelves of this ſatisfaction and contentment of Mind; Men ſeek it in every thing, and even thoſe things which are Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to one another, do each pretend to be infallible Guides to it: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Religion, Philoſophy and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Worldly Prudence or Policy, and an affected contempt of it, which I know no name for, do all promiſe to teach us the Art of Satisfaction; but it will not be a very difficult task, when we have examined the pretences of each, to reſolve which we are to follow.</p>
                     <p>Ignorance, Luſt, and Fancy are too blind, raſh, and violent for us to abandon our ſelves to their Conduct; nor are they more giddy and inconſtant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than weak and ſubject to all the Changes and odd Accidents of the World; ſo that ſhould they lead us on to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we have reaſon to apprehend Pain the next moment, and at beſt, they leave us not in a Condition, either rationally

to approve our Enjoyments, or to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves againſt the loſs of them.</p>
                     <p>Worldly Policy is built wholly upon Miſtakes, it propoſes to us things under the notion of great and good, which when we have examined, we find not worth our ſeeking, and of theſe it can give us no aſſurance, whether we reſpect their Acquiſition or Poſſeſſion; and the ways it preſcribes to put us in poſſeſſion of all that ſatisfaction which reſults from theſe things, have ſomething in them ſo mean, ſo laborious, ſo uncertain, ſo vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that no Succeſs can compenſate that trouble and ſhame which the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing for them puts us to.</p>
                     <p>Atheiſm pretends indeed to extinguiſh our Guilt and Fears, but it does alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face all the beauty and lovelineſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions; it pretends indeed to let looſe the Reins to Pleaſure, but withal, it leaves us no ſupport under Evil; it takes off indeed many Reſtraints, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it unchains and lets looſe our Paſſions: In a word, it leaves us nothing truly great or lovely to enjoy in this World, or hope for in another; and if its Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were uſeful to us, yet have they no certainty, no foundation; it derives all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:39250:101"/>
its credit from the Confidence, not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Men, who under colour of a free and impartial Philoſophy, advance the Intereſt of thoſe Luſts to which they are intirely enſlaved.</p>
                     <p>Religion then only remains to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; this rectifies our Opinions, and diſpels our Errors, and routs thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of imaginary Evils which terrifie and torment the World, much more than Spirits and Ghoſts do; this diſcovers to us Objects worthy of all the love and admiration of our Souls; this expiates our Guilt, and extinguiſhes our Fear; this ſhews us the happineſs of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition, and opens us a glorious proſpect of our future one; this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us the happy tendancy of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Evils, and the glorious reward of them; and in one word, teaches us both to enjoy and ſuffer; it moderates our deſires of things uncertain, and out of our power, and fixes them upon thoſe things for which we can be reſponſible; it raiſes the Mind, clears the Reaſon, and finally forms us into ſuch an united ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and compacted ſtate of ſtrength, that neither the Judgment is eaſily ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor the Affections hurried by any
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:39250:101"/>
violent tranſport or emotion. But do I not here immitate Phyſicians, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to the moſt dangerous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and neglect others? Whether I do or no, they who read ſuch general Directions, are wont to do ſo in their Application of them; and moſt are apt to look upon Religion as deſigned only to redreſs ſubſtantial and formidable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. And yet 'tis with the Mind as with the Body, thô Fevors, Impoſthumes, Defluxions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> kill, the anger of a puſtle, the pain of a Tooth, do ſtrangely diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſturb; and thus thô Pain, and Death, and ſuch like Evils, overthrow and overwhelm the Mind, yet are there a croud of ſlight and trifling Evils which diſquiet and diſcompoſe it; and this is a Matter not to be contemn'd, eſpecially by me, in the proſecution of the Deſign I am here upon, ſince I perſwade my ſelf that the great and formidable Evils, Guilt, Pain, Poverty, Sickneſs, Death, or the Thoughts and Apprehenſions of them, do but very rarely afflict the Life of Man; but there are other Evils of a ſlighter Nature, which like Pirates, are perpetually cruiſing on our Coaſts, and thô they cannot invade and deſtroy, do
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:39250:102"/>
much diſturb and annoy us. Nay, what is yet more, 'tis very uſual to ſee Men acquit themſelves very honourably under true and ſubſtantial Evils, who come off very poorly from the Encounter of ſlight and deſpicable ones; how common is it, for one who maintains bravely his Courage and Judgment amidſt Swords and Bullets, to loſe all Patience, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Government, when attacked by a rude Jeſt, a brisk, or it may be a bold and ſenſleſs Reflection; to ſee a Man that hears very calmly the loſs of a Ship, or a conſiderable Sum of Money, tranſported into ſtrange indecency upon the breaking of a Glaſs, or the ſpoiling of a Diſh of Meat; and he who ſits ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tamely and unconcernedly down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a diſgraceful Character, ſweats and raves if robbed but of a Cabbage or an Apricock: Theſe, and ſuch like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, one may make every day, and almoſt in every Company; and what is the worſt of all, our Fears and Sorrows, our Hate and Anger, are as violent and uneaſie, when they ſpring from Cauſes of the leaſt, as of the higheſt moment. We bewail fantaſtick and true Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with the ſame ſighs and tears, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:39250:102"/>
reſent imaginary and ſubſtantial Injuries with the ſame diſordered Pulſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Looks. When I have reflected on all this, I have often thought that it was as neceſſary to the tranquility of Humane Life, to guard my ſelf againſt Duſt and Flies, as againſt Storms and Tempeſts, to arm my ſelf againſt the ſtings of a ſwarm of vexatious Accidents, as againſt Peſtilence, and War, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and Blindneſs, or Deafneſs. And to this end theſe three or four following Rules have often been of great uſe to me. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the Evils of Life I never take more to my ſhare than are really my own, I never travel abroad to find out foreign Miſchiefs to torment my ſelf, as if there were not enough of the Native growth of my Country; my own Mind, my own Body, my own Houſe are Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wide enough for me, and a little too fruitful too, nay, I am not aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I decline, if I can, an Evil even lying in my way, as I do a buſtle or a fray, by paſſing on the other ſide of the Street. I'le never ſplit upon a Shelf or Rock, if I have Sea-room enough. And as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance of Place, ſo a little diſtance of Time, ſerves my turn to make me
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:39250:103"/>
reckon ſuch Evils as none of mine: I'le no more diſtract or diſturb my ſelf with the Evils that are fancied teeming in the Womb of Time, than with thoſe that are now in being in <hi>Peru</hi> or <hi>Mexico;</hi> this is the very Lecture Religion reads me, for ſure to incorporate diſtant Evils, or to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate future ones, were far from <hi>ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be quiet, and doing ones own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> or from thinking with our Saviour, <hi>Sufficient for the day is the Evil thereof,</hi> and were indeed to ſuffer as <hi>buſie bodies, fearful, and unbelievers;</hi> If any man will impute this to me as brutality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, I cannot help it; I thank God that I have ſenſe enough to Practiſe Caution without fear, Care without Anxiety, and Charity without Diſtreſs or Agony of Mind. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to thoſe Evils (I ſpeak ſtill of ſlight and daily ones) which do really fall to my ſhare, and I cannot avoid; my next care is to weaken their Force, to diſarm them of their Sting, their Teeth and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, if they have any; I take from them all the terror that Fancy and Opinion have given them, and will no more, if I can help it, ſuffer my Imagination, than my Taſte or Feeling, to be abuſed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:39250:103"/>
upon. In the next place, I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fortifie and ſtrengthen my ſelf, ſee that my ſtate be healthy, and my Nature firm, leſt I ſhould complain of the Meat, when the fault is in my Stomach; or think the Bed ill made, when the cauſe of my uneaſineſs is in the Body. And laſtly, when I have reduced the Evil to its own natural ſize, generally 'tis of ſuch a Pigmy, Dwarfiſh growth, that I can ſecurely ſlight it, I can maſter it with very little trouble and induſtry, or at worſt with a very little patience; and that I may not be wanting here, I look upon it as a Task I am born to, as an Inconvenience that I can no more ſhun, than any natural Defects in my Body, or my Mind, or than I can the Cares and Fatigues of my Calling. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour above all things to fill my Soul with great and raviſhing Pleaſures, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it with a generous Ambition, and, in one word, to poſſeſs it with that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Poverty of Spirit, Meekneſs, Purity, Charity, commended to his Diſciples by our Lord and Maſter, that I am general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above the buz and fluttering of theſe, rather Impertinences, than Evils of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and do often ſuffer them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:39250:104"/>
being ſenſible of them; but I can never often enough put the World in mind of the vaſt difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fits and habits of theſe Vertues. What we could do in a pious humour, that we ſhould always do, were but the weak Impreſſion once converted into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſhort-liv'd Paſſion changed into ſteady habit; but 'tis high time to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue my Deſign, I am almoſt afraid, I dwell ſo long upon a Head, that the moſt pertinent Parts of my Diſcourſe may now and then look like Digreſſion. The next thing to be conſidered, after the <hi>Cheerfulneſs of the Mind,</hi> is</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Health of the Body. Life does ſo apparently depend on this, that in the vulgar Notion it ſignifies much the ſame thing. 'Tis notorious, Life decays and expires with the health and ſtrength of the Body, and when it is protracted after theſe are gone, it ſcarce deſerves the Name of Life, any more than the Noiſe of an ill-ſtrung and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned Inſtrument does that of Muſick. But I need not teach any Body the value of Health, or preſs them to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, I ſhould be ſufficiently obliging to the World, if I could teach it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:39250:104"/>
any Art by which they might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that Bleſſing which it enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, a long Life of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years. But I know no Art that can raiſe Nature above its own Laws, or retrieve its Youth, if it be now in its Decrepitude: One thing I know, that we too commonly debauch and corrupt Nature firſt, and then load her with our Reproaches and Accuſations; we ſhould undoubtedly live much longer, and this Life would be more healthy and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, that is, more vital than it is, did we but obſerve the dictates of Religion, the Laws of Vertue, and not prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them thoſe of Luſt and Fancy. How much ſoever Men complain of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, 'tis little to be doubted, but that moſt Men do notwithſtanding, ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it themſelves by ſome Crime, or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or other. If we could conſult the ſickly craſie part of Mankind, I mean ſuch as are ſo in the middle, or almoſt beginning of their years, and demand of them what blaſted their Beauty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired their Strength? what thus viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and contaminated their Nature? we ſhould ſoon be reſolved to what Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal their Diſeaſes were owing, if at leaſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:39250:105"/>
their ſhame and bluſhes would give them leave to inform us: And if we ſhould endeavour to trace the Deaths of moſt of thoſe who are gone hence before their time, back to their firſt Cauſe, I do not think but that our ſearch would ſoon end in ſome Vice or Folly or other; this Man drank too much, the other too much indulged his Appetite; one was devoted to his Luſt, and another putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his Sloth, all of them, in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe, <hi>did live too fast;</hi> but in truth and propriety of Speech, <hi>died too fast;</hi> for ſince Life is nothing elſe but acting by Reaſon, every Deviation from it is an Approach towards Death. But to proceed; 'Tis not unuſual to ſee Pride kill one, Paſſion another, Avarice and Ambition a third, while to gratifie theſe Affections, the Body is either expoſed to dangers, or worn out by labour. Now, if we can generally find the Cauſes of moſt early Deaths in Mens Vices, when ſo little of other Mens Lives comes to our knowledge, what think you, ſhould we not be able to diſcover, if we could enter into the Retirements, and penetrate all the Secrets of Mankind, how many hidden Paſſions do gnaw the Heart? how
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39250:105"/>
many ſecret Sins do waſte and conſume the Strength? where, not only Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment excludes the Eye, but a ſhow of probity, nay, a real and eminent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome particular Vertue excludes even Suſpition and Jealouſie. If then Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality do often contract the term of Life, 'tis evident what is to be preſcribed for the prolonging it, Religion or Vertue is the beſt Phyſick: It has often mended an ill Conſtitution, but never ſpoiled a good one. When did ever Chaſtity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the Body, or deflour the Face? when did ever Temperance inflame the Blood, or oppreſs the Spirits? when did ever Induſtry or Vigilance four the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and enfeeble the Nerves? No Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, no Plethories, no Obſtructions, no Aſſidities, no Stagnations, Extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I know not what hard Names, and harder Things, derive themſelves from Vertue or Religion. 'Tis true, a Man may be Righteous over-much, he may entitle his Folly, his Melancholy, his particular Fancy, or his particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion or Conſtitution, Religion, and this may prove miſchievous to him, to his health, to his ſtrength, but then this is not the fault of Religion, but the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39250:106"/>
Man; and to ſpeak properly, this is not Righteouſneſs nor Religion, thô it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, but it is Fancy and Folly, or an ill Conſtitution diſguiſed under the garb and the meen of Religion. Vertue then is the moſt probable way to a long Life, or if not ſo, at leaſt to a more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and honourable Death; for where an early Death is the Reſult of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not a Crime, we muſt needs meet it with leſs Amazement our ſelves, and our Friends behold it with leſs Regret and Affliction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third way of prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, is to engage the Providence of God in its Preſervation. If all the Promiſes God has made the Vertues of a long Life, did really ſignifie nothing, I cannot ſee how we could put up any Requeſt to God, relating to Temporal Protection, with Faith or Fervor, or as much as Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if they ſignifie any thing, then ſurely they muſt ſignifie that his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is actively imployed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of vertuous Men? And how great a Security is this? What can be impoſſible to him who is the Governour and Creator of the World, in whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal all created <hi>Means</hi> are, and in whoſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39250:106"/>
Power it is, if theſe be unſufficient to create new ones? To him whoſe uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Laws can never miſs of thoſe ends he aims at, or if they could, his Power is ever at hand to ſupply their Defects, and accommodate and attemper them to particular Emergencies; and his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is under no ties, no limitations but thoſe of his Divine Wiſdom; well might the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>I laid me down and ſlept, for 'tis thou Lord makest me dwell in ſafety.</hi> Every good Man might ſay the ſame, as far as he has a Divine Warrant, not in Peace and Health only, but in Sickneſs, in a Tempeſt, whether by Sea or Land, in a Plague, in a Battle, in a Siege, in a Storm; to believe our ſelves under the Patronage and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, ſeems to me nothing leſs than to believe that he will make thoſe things we are concerned in, flow with a ſmooth and gentle Stream, that he will place us in a ſtate or condition of Life, ſafe and agreeable; or if not, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and dangers he will contrive the methods of our Reſcue, and where the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary are inſufficient, find out extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; that he will concur and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the natural courſe of things, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:39250:107"/>
if he ſee it fit, that he will exert a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Force, and vouchſafe an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Succour. Plainly thus, thô I know not the unſearchable Methods of Divine Providence, yet from God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf for my good, I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer, that in my ſickneſs, I may hope for that from God, which I cannot from the skill of my Phyſician; that in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Times I may expect that from Providence which I cannot from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice, or Power of the Magiſtrate; that in neceſſitous, involved, and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Circumſtances, I may promiſe my ſelf that Iſſue from his Favour, which I cannot from the Prudence, Integrity, or Bounty of my Friends: And in a word, that in all Caſes I can hope for that from my Prayers, which I otherwiſe could not from Humane Power or Policy. The ſum of all is, all the natural means of our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Life are in the hands of God, and if theſe ſhould be deficient, nothing can reſtrain him from exerting a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Force and Vertue for our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; his fixed and univerſal Laws are infinitely wiſe; but if at any time our Affairs ſhould require his immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſal, I know not why I ſhould fancy
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:39250:107"/>
his Prerogative ſo bounded, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or will not interpoſe; and thô his Pavilion be thick Clouds, and he walk upon the Wings of the Wind; tho' his Providence be a great Abyſs, and the ſwiftneſs and ſecreſie of his actings elude our Search, and baffle our Inquiries, ſo that we cannot diſcern when he Acts by Prerogative, when by Law, yet I doubt not but that he does frequently exert a miraculous and extraordinary Power.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, 'tis plain that our great Buſineſs is to engage the Providence of God on our Behalf, that we may have an unerring Guide of this dubious and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, a firm ſupport of this mortal corruptible Nature; and I think I need not prove that Religion is the effectual way to oblige God, if this be the great Meſſage that we have received of the Son of God, <hi>that God is Light,</hi> then St. <hi>John</hi>'s Inference muſt needs be good, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who walks in the Light, can maintain a Communion with him, that is, be dear and acceptable to him; a Spiritual and rational Worſhip muſt be the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to endear our ſelves to a God, who is a wiſe Spirit. Nay, tho' all the Precepts of Religion ſhould not be neceſſarily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:39250:108"/>
founded in their conſonancy and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to the Divine Nature, yet ſtill ſince they are the Precepts of God, we need ſearch for no other Reaſon for the acceptableneſs of our obedience: 'Tis true, all the heights of Purity, to which the Goſpel invites us, are not neceſſary to the health and ſtrength of the Body, yet are they ſerviceable to the perfection and improvement of our Nature; they are not all indiſpenſible to the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Temporal Affairs, but they are uſeful to the Felicity and Glory of our Eternal; and therefore the more Religious we are, the more we ſhall pleaſe God: But I will inſiſt no longer on ſo unconteſted a Point, Nature it ſelf dictates, that an imitation of their Vertues is the ſtrongeſt Obligation we can lay upon the Wiſe or Good; and Obedience the moſt effectual Recommendation of us to the Soveraign Powers; whether therefore we conſider God as the <hi>Best,</hi> or the <hi>Greatest,</hi> the Characters under which the very Light of Nature did ever repreſent him, Religion, that is, Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Obedience, are the only ways by which we may ever come to pretend to his Favour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:39250:108"/>Nor is Vertue leſs apt to procure the Favour and Amity of Man than that of God; it fences us about with the Arms and Succours of Mankind, if guards us with all their Eyes, and with all their Prayers; for their Love and Reverence make them both active and wakeful in our Service.</p>
                     <p>How directly repugnant to all this are the Effects of Irreligion; it leaves us no other Safeguard than that of our own Strength and Vigilance; which, to ſpeak properly, is to deliver us up into the hands of our Folly and Fear, our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cowardiſe: For alas, what were my ſingle Reaſon or Force, when I have neither God nor Man to ſecond me! how much leſs when the Indignation of the one, and the ſecret Averſion or open En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the other, ſcare and intimidate me! how can a Man hold out againſt Dangers, if he be betrayed by his own Guilt within, and his Reaſon over-thrown by ominous Fears, do not leſſen, but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his Terrors: Hence is that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The wicked flee when no Man purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but the Righteous are as bold as a Lion:</hi> Abandoned by God and Man, he ſeems at laſt abandoned by himſelf too.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:39250:109"/>
you contend for? how are thoſe Texts which make length of days the Reward of Obedience to the Divine Laws, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable with thoſe other, which, as far as concerns their Temporal Effects, ſeem to equal Wiſdom and Folly, and level Righteouſneſs with Wickedneſs, aſſerting the promiſcuouſneſs of all Events to the Vertuous and Vitious? <hi>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth not: As is the good, ſo is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an Oath,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2. And this is extended as far as Death it ſelf; <hi>How dieth the wiſe man? as the fool,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.16. Innumerable are the Anſwers to this Objection, but one only fits my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is plainly this, That theſe are Rhetorical Exaggerations of Humane Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Wiſe and Good Men, as well as others, have their Natural Paſſions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divine Writings have their Figures, as well as thoſe that are purely Humane: Theſe therefore, and the like Speeches, deſign not to derogate from the Efficacy of Vertue, or weaken the force of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:39250:110"/>
Divine Promiſes, but to humble the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Man, and convert his fondneſs for this World into a greater for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and are not therefore to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in ſuch a general and unlimited ſenſe, as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteous and the Wicked, with reſpect to Temporal Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Life and Death; but only thus, that the Righteous are not ſo univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Temporal Evils, but that ſome or other of them, in all Ages, are liable to them, even to an untimely Death it ſelf: But what then, ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inſtances of an inſcrutable Providence, ought no more to derogate from the Excellence of Wiſdom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or the Veracity of God, than ſome few Shipwracks ought to diſcredit Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or the failing of ſome few Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders diſparage Art and Induſtry; 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the experienced and skilful, the careful and diligent, do generally Sail and Trade ſucceſsfully.

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:39250:110"/>If long Life be a great Bleſſing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and recommends Men to greater afterwards, and if Religion and Vertue be on both theſe Accounts entitled to it, whence is it that an immature Death ſnatches away ſometimes the beſt of Men, that it ſtops them in the very progreſs of their Vertue, and in a full career to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Perfection and Glory? I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Providence of God is a great Deep, <hi>His Judgments are unſearchable, and his ways past finding out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. I cannot believe that this early Death, which intercepts the Fruits of a growing Vertue, ſhall bereave the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of any degree of that future Glory, to which ſuch Fruits would have enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled them, I ſhould rather think, with the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that having compleated their Perfection in a little time, they had in a little time finiſhed their Courſe, and by what they did do, gave ſuch plain Proofs of what they would do, that God rewards their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as he does the Actions of others, and therefore haſteneth to take them to himſelf. But however this matter be, I am content to believe,</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:39250:111"/>3. That as God orders all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Events of Life to the Good of thoſe that love him, ſo much more muſt he diſpoſe this biggeſt Event that befals a mortal Man, that is, Death, to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Benefit; and therefore this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Death is doubtleſs, to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, better than Life, thô we ſhould not be able to diſcern why. They dye in their Perfection, their Glory yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied, their Felicity unſtained, no vile Temptation, no Misfortune having yet triumphed over them, an Advantage which we much admire when we ſee great and good Men ſurprized, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by Weakneſſes and Calamities, for then we cannot but acknowledge, that if Death had come ſooner it had been much kinder, for they had been gathered into the Store-houſe of the Dead, like Corn into the Granary before unſeaſonable or immoderate Rain had corrupted it, or any malignant Vapors blaſted it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I know not how Heaven has dealt with theſe its Favourites, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture 'tis in the Moral as in the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal World, ſome are born to that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which others acquire with labour;

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of improving Life, or living much in a little time.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>What is to be underſtood by improving or exalting Life, and the Advantages of this Notion. Three ways of improving Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> By perfecting Nature. Man and Life, mean things till Wiſdom and Vertue ſtamp a value on them. This particularly exemplified, <hi>with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Knowledge,</hi> and the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> By beginning to Live betimes, or at least immediately. No Objection againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming preſantly wiſe and happy, but the difficulty of becoming ſo. An Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Addreſſed, <hi>1.</hi> To the Young. <hi>2.</hi> To thoſe advanced in Years. Cloſed with a Reflection on the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> By avoiding all thoſe things that are injurious to Life; as Sloth, Impertinence, Remiſsneſs or Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religion; Levity and Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:39250:112"/>
Some other Directions deferred to the following Treatiſes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO underſtand aright what it is I here aim at, what I mean by the <hi>Improvement</hi> or <hi>Exaltation of Life,</hi> 'tis neceſſary to call to mind the true Notion of Life laid down in the beginning, That it is the right uſe of all our Powers and Faculties, the rational Exerciſe, the wiſe Imployment of our whole Nature. Now if this be ſo, 'tis plain that we live juſt as much as we act and enjoy, I mean always rationally; that as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and grow up towards a Perfection of Nature, the more is Life alſo raiſed and refined: Thus if the Life of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be to think, to diſcover and contemplate Truth and Goodneſs, then ſurely its Life is enlarged with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; if the Life of the Soul of Man, I mean his Will and Affections, be to chooſe and purſue, admire and love true Good then certainly our Life is perfected with our Vertue, and augmented with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In a word, if the Life of Man do not conſiſt in the Motion of Animal Spirits, but the Exerciſe of his Rational Powers and Faculties; if the true Health
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:39250:113"/>
of Man be not to be judged by the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of his Pulſe, but the harmony of his Affections; if finally, the thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Life be not to be meaſured by Hours, and Days, and Months, and Years, but by Activity and Enjoyment, by the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Acts of a Rational Nature; then ſure I may boldly conclude, That the more regularly and conſtantly we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the proper Buſineſs of our Nature, the more actively and vigorouſly we are carried on towards that which is our proper Good, ſo much the more we <hi>live,</hi> ſo much the more rich and racie, the more true, natural, and pure is Life; and all this is no other Philoſophy than what the Wiſe-man has long ago advanced; <hi>For honourable Age is not that which ſtandeth in length of time, nor that is meaſured by number of years But Wiſdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life is old age,</hi> Wiſdom 4. 8, 9. This indeed is a Truth of too vaſt an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be a new one; for were it but once throughly imbibed, it would relieve all the Preſſures, and redreſs all the Grievances of Humane Life. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Life, that it is dull and nautious, we impeach it a vanity and vexation of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:39250:113"/>
ſhortneſs and uncertainty, how would this one Notion, well purſued, ſoon ſilence all theſe Complaints; he would never think Life too ſhort, who where ripe for Death; he would never complain that Life were uncertain, who were always ready to die; he would not accuſe Life of dulneſs and nauſeouſneſs, who were daily advancing his Diſcovery of Truth, and enlarging his Poſſeſſion of Good; nor would he ever charge it with Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vexation, were his Actions ſtill wiſe and rational; for thus every act of Life would be an act of Fruition too, being both agreeable to Nature, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a delightful Approbation and Complacency of Conſcience. By this time 'tis plain what the Deſign of this Chapter is, namely, to compenſate the ſhortneſs by the excellence of Life, and redreſs the vanity and vexation of it by its Perfection; a Deſign, I confeſs, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a more comprehenſive Mind, and a more elevated Fancy than mine; a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, demanding all the Wiſdom and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of an Active, and all the Thought and Learning of a Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life; a Deſign, in a word, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at once the Prudence of old Age,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:39250:114"/>
and the Vigour of blooming Years; that I am willing to contribute the little I can towards it, proceeds from a ſenſe of its being a Duty I owe my ſelf and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; let me not therefore be oppreſſed by the grandeur of my Subject, and the expectation of my Reader, I promote the good of Mankind in my way, and as I am able, it were a Crime if I did not, and it will be Injuſtice to expect more from me: Beſides, I purpoſe not here to lay out my whole ſtrength, thô this be little, having deſtined an entire Volume to <hi>Humane Perfection;</hi> and therefore ſhall here Diſcourſe but very briefly, and in very general terms, of the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life.</p>
                  <p>All the Advice I ſhall offer here, may be reduced to theſe Three Heads.</p>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we begin to live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; or if we cannot now do that, our Years being far ſpent, that we begin to live immediately.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we avoid all thoſe things that are Enemies to our true Life.</item>

                  <div n="1" type="subsection">
                     <head>Sect. 1.</head>
                     <p>We muſt endeavour to perfect and exalt our Nature. The Neceſſity of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:39250:114"/>
this will be very conſpicuous to any one, who ſhall conſider that the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Acts depends upon the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Faculties and Powers, juſt as the pleaſure of Seeing does on the goodneſs of the Eye, or that of Hearing on the Perfection of the Ear, ſo much, and much more, does the Beauty of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Action, and the Guſt of all our Enjoyments depend upon the clearneſs of the Judgment, the rectitude of the Will, and the vigour of our Paſſions. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Argument yet more viſible and palpable, let us conſider how mean a thing Man were, and how contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life, without Cultivation or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Body is but a heap of Duſt, ſomething there needs to ſtamp a value upon it; ſomething there muſt be to give Sweetneſs to the Eye, Charm to the Tongue, and Grace to Motion: 'Tis a meer Machine alike capable of being made the Inſtrument of Cruelty or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of Luſt or Chaſtity, of Avarice or Charity; 'tis Religion muſt purge and ſanctifie it; 'tis Wiſdom muſt conduct and guide it, and make it the happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of great and glorious Actions. The Spirit within us is a volatile, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:39250:115"/>
unſteady thing, capable of all ſorts of Impreſſions, ſuſpended as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth, floating between the different Shores of Good and Evil: Knowledge and Vertue forms it into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, ſtamps a ſort of Divinity upon it, for we art not born, but made great; 'tis Wiſdom that imprints it with bright I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's, that impregnates it with noble Paſſions, and determines its tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its true Good and ſupreme Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Our Converſation with the World is naturally nothing elſe but a dull enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Forms, and Ceremonies, and Civilities, a nauſeous Circulation of the ſame taſtleſs and ſuperficial Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a tedious and repeated purſuit of vain miſtaken ends, and often baffled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; 'tis Vertue and Knowledge that gives guſt and reliſh to our Enjoyments, and Life and Spirit to all our Actions; that leads us on towards excellent Ends, and inſpires us with immortal Hopes; our Fortune and Condition in the World is naturally a fluctuating unſtable Agitation, made up of a confuſed and motly varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Events; Knowledge and Vertue fix the floating Iſland, and give Light and Beauty to the Chaos.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:39250:115"/>I can never carry this Argument too far, and therefore I will yet a little more particulary conſider what Acceſſion or Increaſe of <hi>Life</hi> we derive from <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> our Natures. Does Life conſiſt in the Exerciſe of our Faculties? True Life then is the Portion of the Active and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious; the dull and heavy Motion of the Sluggard is but a faint Imitation or Reſemblance of it; 'tis a diſeaſed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing thing, a compound or mixture wherein there ſeems to be more of Death than Life. Does Life conſiſt in Fruition? how dark and diſmal are thoſe of the Wicked, compared to the calm and bright days of the Good! for what can there be like Enjoyment to that Man, who dares make no Reflections on the paſt, nor can entertain any juſt Hopes of the future, and whoſe Mind concurs not with his preſent Paſſions, and refuſes to joyn in the ſenſleſs Deſigns he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Does Life laſtly conſiſt, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it does, in the Knowledge of Truth and Love of Goodneſs? how ſcanty, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and beggarly is the Life of the Fool and Sinner, compared to that of the Wiſe and Vertuous! <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, <hi>One vertuous day was to be preferred before a ſinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:39250:116"/>
this is true in the preſent Senſe and Notion of Life; Error and Ignorance are as it were a Diſeaſe or State of Inſenſibleneſs, and Death to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the Mind, that is utterly ignorant of Objects worthy of it, has nothing to imploy it ſelf upon, or at leaſt nothing that gives it any ſolid Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the Mind, which is filled with the Knowledge of excellent things, has a great variety of Scenes to entertain it, and never wants ſome freſh Occaſion of delight and wonder. But it will be ſaid, Does not the Fool behold the viſible World as well as the Philoſopher? He does; but juſt as he reads a Poem, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the Artfulneſs of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, the Richneſs of the Fancy, or Variety of the Incidents. The Sinner hears talk too of an inviſible World, of Moral Perfections hear, and of Divine Joys hereafter; but he hears it unmoved, unaffected, which ſhews he has no live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Notion, no diſtinct Perception of any thing of this kind; the Glaſs is dulled and ſullied; Beauty it ſelf would looſe all Charm, reflected thus. But Humane Perfection conſiſts not in Knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but alſo in the Purity of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:39250:116"/>
Heart, in the regulation of the Affections, in Love and true Liberty, that is, the Heart muſt be ſet upon Objects worthy of it, and we muſt purſue our true Good with vigour and conſtancy; and this is that which renders Life truly delightful and uniform; without Objects to ingage our Affections, we can ſcarcely be ſaid to live, we ſhall be becalmed, and ſcarce be ſenſible of the breath we draw; and unleſs theſe Objects be worthy and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, all is but Storm and Tempeſt, Cheat and Torment, and our Faculties are not rationally imployed, but abuſed, deluded, depraved, tortured. Could we but comprehend what all this did amount to, or at leaſt, could we feel and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it, we ſhould ſoon diſcern that the Wiſe and Good, and they only, did truly live; for theſe only know God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe only admire, and love, and rejoyce, and hope rationally; and theſe only are not confined nor limited in their Knowledge or their Affections, for the Objects of both are infinite; their Minds can never travel ſo far in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God and the moſt important Truths, but that there is ſtill a new World to be further diſcovered; nor can
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39250:117"/>
their Admiration or Love, their Joy or Hope, ſo enlarge themſelves, as ever to equal the Objects of theſe Paſſions, and reach the utmoſt that is in them. But 'tis probable after all, the Fool and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will pretend to engroſs the Goods of the Earth, as if they alone were to poſſeſs and enjoy them, as if they were the Heirs of this World, the Righteous of the other; but this is a vain fancy, and has been often baffled. Who can haſten more to enjoy, than he who knows the true value and right uſe of all things? And who can enjoy more in any thing, than he who at once gratifies his Reaſon and his Appetite, and pleaſes his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without forfeiting his true Liberty? If to be fooled and cheated, if to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared and tormented, by the things of this World, be a Pleaſure, in this the Chriſtian muſt indeed give place to the Infidel, the Righteous Man to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>The Sum then of this whole Matter is, Life in the fooliſh, mean, and vicious Soul, ſeems like a little Rill of Water, confined within narrow and ſcanty Bounds, or like the Light of a Candle incloſed within the narrow compaſs of a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:39250:117"/>
Dark-Lanthorn; but in the Wiſe and Underſtanding, 'tis like a mighty Stream which ſwells above its Banks, and ſpreads it ſelf over a vaſt Plain; or like Light unconfined, which diffuſes and darts it ſelf over all the Face of Nature. Ah! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how much does it import me, to fill my Underſtanding with bright and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Images, with pleaſing and important Notions, with all the Truths that can ſerve, either to delight or guide, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or adorn, to ſupport or fortifie me in this World, or advance my Title to the Joys of another? How much does it import me, to fill my Soul with Love, Love of all that is Good or Great; Love of all that's Pure or Sacred; Love of all that's Beautiful or Delightful? and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my Body may be a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a Mind, it does not a little import me, that this be ſtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, vigorous and vivatious.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond way to improve Life, is to begin to Live betimes; or at leaſt, if our Years be far ſpent, to begin to Live immediately, which is all we can do. Life, in my Notion of it, dawns with our Reaſon, and grows up to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection with the Vertue, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39250:118"/>
and Tranquillity of the Soul. To be Wiſe, and to be Religious, this is to Live, for in this conſiſts Fruition and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; in this the Health and Vigour of our Faculties; in this the Harmony and Beauty of the whole Frame of our Nature; and this, and no other, is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and agreeable Exerciſe of all our Powers and Capacities. Whoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will improve Life, ought to begin next moment to aſſert his Liberty, and to give up himſelf to true Philoſophy; 'tis ſtrange to ſee how Men put off this, or attempt it only ſuperficially, and by the by; they prefer, I will not ſay Trades and Husbandry, and various ſorts of Knowledge, foreign and remote from the Service and Conduct of Humane Life, (ah! that Time were but ſo well ſpent in general;) but they prefer even Dreſſing, Painting, Drinking, Gaming, and all, not only the moſt ſilly and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, but the moſt vile and infamous ways of conſuming Time, before true Wiſdom and Philoſophy: Nay, amongſt thoſe that make profeſſion of Wiſdom, and pretend to have dedicated themſelves to the Doctrine of Jeſus, 'tis common to ſee great numbers Hearing, Talking,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39250:118"/>
Reading, Diſputing, without ever making any uſe of thoſe Truths they ſtudy and contend for, or feeling any warmth or influence of them; like thoſe wiſe ones in Temporals, who are laying up Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and Treaſure all their Life long, which they will never uſe, never enjoy. Ah wretched Conſumption of Life! how ſoon will the laſt Minute expire? And the unhappy Man will not have lived one Year, one Month, one Day, but will have waſted a precious Treaſure of Time, and he muſt go immediately and account for it. Well, let the World live after its own faſhion, I plainly ſee the Point I am to make; no Day, no Hour ſhall paſs me unimployed, every Moment, if I can, I will grow wiſer and better; 'tis not how long I laſt, but how much I live; I will <hi>Know,</hi> I will <hi>Act,</hi> I will <hi>Enjoy</hi> to Day, and then I am ſure I have lived a Day; this moſt propoſe to do, ſome time or other, but not to Day: And why not to Day? why not preſently? is there any Evil in being immediately wiſe, immediately free, immediately rational, immediately happy? It cannot be, if the ſtate I am in be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good; if the Pleaſures I enjoy be really ſuch as my Reaſon can ſhare in,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39250:119"/>
and my Conſcience can approve? I then indeed live. There's no need of Change and Reformation, but Continuance and Perſeverance; but it they be not, why will I not exchange? Falſe for true, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational for rational Pleaſures: If I am in the right? if my Condition be truly good and ſafe, 'tis well; there's nothing further to be done, but to maintain my Ground: But if I am in the wrong, if the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be unſound and rotten, and whilſt I dream not of it, my Health and Fortune, I mean my imaginary Happineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume inwardly, waſte and decay inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, why am I fond of the Cheat? why am I unwilling to be undeceived and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſed? And why not preſantly? The Reaſon is plain, they acknowledge the Repreſentation I have made to them of a vertuous and Rational Life, is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and taking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to be born into this new State, to come forth into this moral Light is as troubleſome, as the Infants being born into the Natural: They love the Eaſe and Wealth of a proſperous Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but not the Hardſhips of his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip the Thrift and Confinement of his Beginnings. They love Lawrels and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Arches, the Glory and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39250:119"/>
of Victory, but cannot endure the Toils and Hazards of War. Or plainly thus, they admire Liberty of Mind, Serenity and Rational Joy, but it will coſt them much Labour and Pains to purchaſe it. Thus the wretched Man, fearing the Regiment of Phyſick, wears out a miſerable Life in the Pains of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and one that has a Cancer or Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene chooſes to waſte and rot in Pain by Piece-meal, rather than undergo the ſhort pain of Amputation or Abſition. Nay, what is worſe than all this, Men are fond of their Diſeaſes, love the things that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and nouriſh them, as the groſs and corpulent do reſt, the Lethargic ſleep, and the Hydropick drink.</p>
                     <p>This is the ſtate, the deplorable ſtate of the far greater part of Mankind, a ſtate of Diſeaſe and Death, a ſtate of Bondage and Captivity, a ſtate of Infatuation and Enchantment; and I very much fear, that whatever Motives can be extracted out of the Subject I am now upon, will be too weak and feeble; for what can all the Diſcourſes in the World about Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſure and the Satisfactions of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Vertuous Life amount to with Men wholly given up to Senſuality, and

incapable of reliſhing any pure and ſacred Delights? If I have ſucceeded ſo far, as to poſſeſs them with an Opinion that a Life of Reaſon or Religion is a Life of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, thô they have not any true guſt or clear and lively Notion of this Pleaſure, 'tis the utmoſt I can hope for; but to perſwade theſe Men to embrace this Life, there is need of all the Arguments that either Reaſon or Religion can adminiſter; and theſe too pointed with all the Life and Spirit, with all the Edge and Flame that Wit or Judgment can give them; a Task too hard for me! O God! thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Mankind, that thou wouldeſt aid me by thy Spirit, while I ſtrive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Young and Old to ſeek thy Glory and their own Happineſs, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Vertue and true Pleaſure. I will firſt addreſs my ſelf to the Young, and then to thoſe more advanced in Years.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To the Younger. You are now in your Bloom, what glorious Fruit may you bring forth! what Honour may you do God! what Service may you render your Relations and your Country! and what Joys and Bleſſings may you not heap upon your ſelves! Time and Tide ſeem to wait upon you; even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:39250:120"/>
and Grace of God, with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be it ſaid, ſeem to attend and court you. But ah! remember, they will not do ſo for ever; theſe Smiles and Invitations of Heaven and Nature will not laſt continually; your Infidelity or Ingratitude, your Folly and Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, will ſoon blaſt and wither all theſe fair Hopes, turn all your Pleaſures into Gall and Wormwood, and all your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Advantages into the Inſtruments of your Ruine, and Aggravations of it too: Grace will ſoon retire, Nature degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Time grow old, the World deſpiſe you, the God of it frown upon you, and Conſcience, guilty Conſcience will be either ſtupified and benumed, or feſter and rage within you, and Death will come, and then Judgment; and how ſoon 'twill come, ah! who knows; ſudden and early Deaths ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you on what uncertain Ground you ſtand; the Scythe of Death ſtays not always till the Harveſt be ripe, but promiſcuouſly mows down the Young and Old. Ah! begin, begin then to live; ſeize upon Pleaſure and Happineſs while they ſtand courting and inviting you; purſue Vertue and Glory immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39250:121"/>
while the Difficulties are fewer, your Strengths and Aids greater; your Judgments being not yet corrupted by the Maxims, or rather the Fancies of the World, nor your Wills yet diſabled and enſlaved by a Cuſtom of Sin. Ah! ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not to devote your Youth to Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Folly, on preſumption of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Age to Repentance and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: For if this were a Rational and Juſt Deſign in it ſelf, yet is it to you a very unſafe and doubtful one: For which way can you enſure Life, or on what ground can you confide on the morrow? <hi>Boaſt not of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27.1.</p>
                     <p>I know what Oppoſition will be raiſed againſt this kind of Exhortation, and with what rude Reflections they will be treated: <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>this is our Springs, let us enjoy our ſelves whilſt we have time and vigour; Religion looks too grave and formal for theſe years: we ſhall have time enough to he dull and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy: Come on then, let us enjoy our ſelves as becomes our Youth; this is our Portion, and our Lot is this; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they who have now out-liv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39250:121"/>
whoſe Blood is four, and Spirits low, may gravely talk againſt theſe things; they too, when time was, admired what they now would have us deſpiſe as Vanity, and committed themſelves, what they now condemn in us.</hi> In Anſwer to this, let us paſs over the briskneſs and the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and examine the Senſe and Reaſon of this ſort of Talk: The Subſtance of it may be reduced to three Heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt, Youth is the Seaſon of Pleaſure, <hi>i. e.</hi> Sin and Folly; Inclination and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity conſpire to invite you to it, therefore you indulge it. What a ſtrange Argument is this? Is there any Period of our Life, from our Cradle almoſt to bur Coffin, I mean from the moment we arrive at the uſe of Reaſon to our Grave, wherein ſome Sin or other is not in ſeaſon: May not Manhood defend Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and old Age Covetouſneſs, by the ſame Argument by which you do your ſinful Pleaſures? If Inclination to a folly would juſtifie our Commiſſion of it, in what part of Life ſhould we begin to be Wiſe and Vertuous? 'Twill be hard to find the time wherein we ſhall have no Inclination to any Sin or Folly; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if this be ſo, who can be Guilty?
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:39250:122"/>
The Adulterer will impute his Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the impetus of his Luſt; the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer his Bloodſhed to the violence of his Rage, <hi>i. e.</hi> each of them their Sins to the ſtrength of their Inclinations, and if your Argument be good, they will be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But do not deceive your ſelves, then is your Obedience, as moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, ſo moſt indiſpenſable in it ſelf, when you lie under Temptations to Sin, and Heaven is propoſed as a Reward, not of following, but conquering your Inclinations. The ſecond part of the Objection is, That Religion doth not look very graceful in young Years. This I could never well underſtand; if you be ſo fooliſh as to think Religion conſiſts in ſour Faces, or an affected Moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sullenneſs, or in Stupidity and Melancholy, I muſt confeſs you have little Reaſon to be fond of it, for this becomes no Age, and much leſs the more verdant one: But if by Religion you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Devotion towards God, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards your Parents and Superiours, Temperance and Chaſtity in your ſelves, and ſuch like Vertues; I muſt needs ſay, nothing can appear to me more great and lovely than Religion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:39250:122"/>
in Youth; what can better become thoſe who poſſeſs the Gifts of Nature in their Perfection, than Gratitude to the God of Nature? What can be a greater Glory to the Young, than Obedience to Parents, and Reverence to their Elders and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours? What does more preſerve, or better become Strength than Sobriety and Temperance? What is a more charming or more laſting Ornament to Beauty than Modeſty and Chaſtity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, 'tis a vain thing to comfort your ſelves with ſaying, That the Grave and Wiſe, when they had the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations you now have, did as you do, indulge and gratifie them: For <hi>first,</hi> this is not generally true; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the leſs they did it, the more were they honoured and beloved; but <hi>thirdly,</hi> if they did, 'tis certain that they have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemned it, and repented of it: And is it not ſtrangely abſurd, that you ſhould propoſe to your ſelves nothing in the Lives of the Wiſe and Vertuous but their Frailties and Errors for your Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that you ſhould pitch upon that only for your Imitation, which all the Wiſe and Good deteſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan, as their Sin and Shame, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:39250:123"/>
think it their higheſt Wiſdom to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Addreſs to the younger ſort, unleſs there be any who are poſſeſſed with a Spirit of Infidelity, againſt which I will not now enter the Liſts, all the Pretences you can poſſibly form for your differring to devote your ſelves inſtantly to Wiſdom and Religion, are founded in two Suppoſitions, of which the one is falſe, and the other abſurd: The falſe one is, That Sin is a State of Pleaſure, Vertue of Trouble and Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the contrary of which is, I think, ſufficiently demonſtrated through this whole Treatiſe, and would you but be prevailed with to taſte the Pleaſures of a ſincere Vertue, your Experience would ſoon confute this Fancy; what madneſs then is it to be afraid of becoming hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py too ſoon? Ah! how differently are we affected under the Maladies of the Mind and of the Body: Did the Lame or Blind, the Lepers, the Lunaticks or Demoniacks, ever entreat our Lord to defer their Cure, and give them leave to enjoy their Miſeries, Diſeaſes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, a little longer. The other Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is abſurd, which is, That you will Repent hereafter. Muſt you then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:39250:123"/>
hereafter? Muſt this be the Fruit of all your ſinful Pleaſures, Guilt and Remorſe, Grief and Fear, Diſtreſs and Agony of Soul? Do Revelation and Reaſon, Death and Judgment; do all your ſober and retired Thoughts preach you this one Leſſen <hi>Repentance?</hi> and yet can you reſolve to plunge your ſelves in that Filthineſs which muſt be waſhed off with Tears? Can you reſolve to indulge thoſe cheating and deceitful Luſts which will one day fill your Soul with ſhame and ſorrow, with diſtraction, horror and amazement? Ah Infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! ah Bewitchery! that ever a rational Creature ſhould live in ſuch an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and hoſtility againſt his Reaſon! and yet, if <hi>Repentance,</hi> after many years, and innumerable ſins, would be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? if your Sins would be more eaſily conquered, or more eaſily attoned? this Frenſie would not want ſome little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but how contrary is this to Truth? which puts me in mind of another ſort of Readers, to whom I am now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf, namely,</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, To thoſe who are advanced in years. 'Tis obſerved of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> that lighting upon the Statue of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:39250:124"/>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Gades,</hi> and reflecting on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he had yet done nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable at thoſe years, wherein that (in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Notion of Gallantry) brave and gallant Man had over-run all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> he did ſweat and bluſh under the keen Reproaches of his own Mind, and groaned under the uneaſie Conſcience of his Sloth, and preſently deſired to be diſmiſſed from his Queſtorſhip, that he might purſue Glory and Immortality, Fame and Dominion. Had you but one ſpark, I will not ſay of the Zeal of a Chriſtian, but of this generoſity of a Pagan, you would bluſh at the Soul, to think that you have not yet buckled on the Armour of Light, at an Age in which many others have been cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Lawrels; that you have not yet ſtarted forth at thoſe years, in which ſome others have finiſhed, thô not their Race, yet all the Difficulties of it; the miſerable account that you will give of thirty, forty, peradventure of fifty years! I will not ſay that you have lived to no purpoſe, but to the worſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; ignorant, enſlaved to Luſt, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Guilt! all that you have done
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:39250:124"/>
is, <hi>You have treaſured up wrath against the day of wrath:</hi> For this to be the product of ſo many years! Shame and Confuſion! But greater, infinitely greater to go on thus. Sin may to ſome ſeem the Misfortune of Youth, but 'tis unqueſtionably the Reproach of Age: Unhappy Nature, and unhappy Education bear a ſhare of the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Youth; but in theſe years your own Obſtinacy and Choice engroſs the whole Guilt. Young People are like weak Barks, which in boyſterous Seas and Winds carry too much Sail, and too little Ballaſt; their Judgment is weak and unreſolved, and their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons light and violent as Hurricanes; but riper years do, or ſhould, bring on naturally wiſer and ſtancher thoughts, cooler, ſedater tempers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly Sin in theſe carries a deeper Guilt and ſhame in it: The raw unexperienced Sinner periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whilſt he but taſtes and gazes; the Virgin Soul coming into a ſtrange World, is deflour whilſt it gratifies its Curioſity and Fancy, like <hi>Dinah</hi> when ſhe went forth only to ſee the Daughters of the Land: But the full-grown
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:39250:125"/>
Sinner ſins againſt, not only me Preachers Inſtruction, but his own Experience too; he repeats thoſe Sins which he has often confeſſed to be his Folly and his Shame, and returns like fooliſh Mariners, to thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Seas where they were Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked but the other day: If this be not to outrage Conſcience, defie Reaſon, and dare God, what is? No, you'l ſay, you to do reſolve to repent hereafter? Hereafter? how ill does this word ſound in one who does begin to bow already under the weight of years? Hereafter? how ill does this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage become this decaying mouldring Body? But ſuppoſe the Wheels of Time would ſtop, thô running now down a head-long Precipes; ſuppoſe your Sun would for a while ſtand ſtill, yet what a Work have you to finiſh! what Guilt to expiate! what Sins to vanquiſh! and what a <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> to prepare for! Are theſe ſlight Conſiderations? will your Sins, think you, be eaſily attoned? when their number is ſwoll'n, not only by length of time, but alſo by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled Licenciouſneſs! For Novice
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:39250:125"/>
in Sin is aw'd by Modeſty, held in by Scruples, and diſcouraged by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great and remorſe; but the Veteran Sinner is carried away by a Torrent of debauched Affections, and repeats his Follies with a relentleſs Confidence and unoppoſed Authority. Will it be an eaſie Task to ſubdue thoſe Sins, which have maintained a long and undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Dominion, and exerciſed an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Soveraignty over you? What ſhall awaken that Sinner, who, like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Drunkard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.35. is inſenſible of Stripes and Wounds; and alas! when rouſed out of the Arms of his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> his Locks, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s, are cut off, the Spirits retired, his Strength impaired, and the Force of his Enemy Augmented; and with what will he Conquer? Is it, laſtly, a trivial thing to appear before the Judgment Seat of God, that you ſhould think a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſerve turn to prepare for it. I will ſuppoſe the Judge of the whole World as merciful as you can deſire him, if you will ſuppoſe him too, with Reverence be it ſpoke, to have ſo much Senſe as not to be impoſed on,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:39250:126"/>
ſo much Integrity as to expect Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, thô not Perfection; and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will make that <hi>Judgment</hi> formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. I very much fear that both Young and Old do entertain too mild and favourable a Notion of that Day, and ſo elude and baffle the Force of the moſt powerful Motive to Vertue and Religion the Goſpel has; I ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wander far from the purpoſe of this Paragraph, if I cloſe this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation <hi>to begin to live immediately,</hi> with a ſhort Reflection on that Day.</p>
                     <p>We muſt firſt bid adieu to this World, to every thing in it that's dear to us, and dye e're we can go and appear before God, what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mortification of all our Senſual Appetites is neceſſary, e're we can calmly part with all here below! what a long Experience of Love and Duty is neceſſary to confirm and aſſure the Soul againſt all its Fears and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions! what a vigorous Faith to carry us through this dark Paſſage into another World! when we are got there, what a ſtrict Trial are we to undergo! There all Diſguiſes will be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:39250:126"/>
taken off, and every thing appear in its naked Nature: There all our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures of Hay and Stubble will be burnt up, only pure ſolid Vertue will bear the Teſt: There darling Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will not paſs under the Diſguiſe of Sins of Infirmity: There an honeſt Sloth and harmleſs Luxury, will not be thought Innocence enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title Men to Heaven: There ſome few good fits will not paſs for godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor ſome feeble and ſhort-liv'd Attempts for Repentance and a Change: There the Effects of a lucky Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, will not be crowned as the Works of Grace, and Fruits of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life: There, in a word, talk will not paſs for Action, nor Cenſure of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, commute for Mortification in our ſelves: Finally, nothing ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there but a conquering Faith, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Charity, an humble, conſtant Zeal, patient perſevering Hopes, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joys, and pious Fears. This needs no Application; Begin, begin to live before you dye, begin to repent and reform be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be judged.</p>

                     <p>A third way of <hi>Improving Life</hi> is to avoid and cut off all thoſe things that are injurious to it: Such are Sloth that waſts, and Impertinence that embroils it: Coldneſs or Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religion that diſpirits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes, Levity and Inconſtancy that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confound it: And finally, all thoſe Evils that ſour and imbitter it. I am ſenſible that theſe Heads oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur often, and thô it be under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Aſpects, yet 'tis poſſible that I may ſometimes light upon the ſame Thoughts, nay, peradventure the very ſame words, 'tis againſt my will if I do; but I want ſight to reviſe my Papers, and am glad to disburden my Memory as faſt as I can, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charge it with nothing that I have once entruſted to writing; and the toil of recollecting my Thoughts, ſcattered up and down like <hi>Sybil</hi>'s Oracles in diſperſed Leaves, by a hand which 'tis impoſſible for me to direct or animate, is moſt intollerable; if therefore I ſlip into any Error of this kind, which I ſhall very unwillingly,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:39250:127"/>
I cannot but preſume of Pardon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo juſt an Excuſe. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> We muſt avoid Idleneſs. Sloth is the Ruſt of Time; Sleep is an Image of Death, and Sloth of Sleep: The Life of the ſluggiſh is but a waking Dream, a Vacation from all Buſineſs and true Enjoyment too; a Ceſſation and Stop, thô not of Time, which ſtill runs on, yet of the very Powers and Faculties of the Soul, whereas Life conſiſts in the Exerciſe of both: How remote then muſt Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be from improving or exalting Life? it never ploughs nor ſows, and therefore never reaps; it never plants nor ſets, and therefore never gathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fruit; nothing great was ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by it, nothing great ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by it: And ſhall the richeſt Fruit that ever grew upon any of the Trees of Paradiſe, Wiſdom, and Vertue, <hi>i. e.</hi> Knowledge and Life be gathered by a ſluggiſh hand? No, thô no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or flaming Sword do ſtop his way, yet are there Difficulties in it, too many and too great for this heavy
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:39250:128"/>
daſtardly Animal to conquer. <hi>Plato,</hi> as I remember, tells us ſome where, that a God tied Pain and Pleaſure by the Tails together; there is no coming at the one by him who ſhuns the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So is the World contrived, that even Temporal and ſeeming Goods can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained without the travel of the Mind, and toil of the Body; and yet what lean, ſtarved, and beggarly Bleſſings are theſe, compared to thoſe I treat of. The rich Man may ſtarve for want of true Pleaſure in the midſt of his glittering Heaps: Sorrow may ſit heavy on the Heart of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; or the Bride, even on the days of ſolemn Triumph and Feſtival noiſe: The Prince may be a Slave, an Egyptian Slave, even while he reigns with abſolute and uncontrouled Power: But Life and Pleaſure, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Happineſs, are the inſeparable Companions of Wiſdom and Vertue: Let no man therefore flatter himſelf with the Hopes of ſuch a Treaſure, who lives idlely and at his eaſe; he muſt pray, meditate, watch, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe himſelf in Induſtry, Sobriety,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:39250:128"/>
and Purity, who will overcome the Corruptions of his Nature, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Tranquility and Liberty of a true Chriſtian. Nor let this frighten any Man, for thoſe Duties which are a little troubleſome in the beginning, do ſoon grow eaſie and delightful too. In this ſenſe muſt we underſtand that of the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> Chap. 4.17, 18. thô rendered a little harſhly: <hi>For at the first ſhe</hi> (that is, Wiſdom) <hi>will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her Diſcipline until ſhe may truſt his Soul, and try him by her Laws. Then will ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſtraight-way unto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, and ſhew him her ſecrets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Impertinence, or being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied and imployed in Trifles, is indeed as different from Sloth as Motion from Reſt; but yet ſuch a wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Time cannot deſerve the Name of Life; for this is not Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Soul, but a poor and mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of it: Fancy, and that a ſilly and extravigant one, may be ſaid to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:39250:129"/>
live, but Reaſon cannot. That Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which conſiſts in heavy Paſſive Dulneſs, is like a ſtate of Sleep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dream or Fancy; that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a fluttering and impertinent Activity, is nothing elſe but a giddy Ferment of the Spirits, and Agitation of the Fancy, the incoherent disjoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thoughts, the confuſed and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Projects and Attempts of a Dream, and we may almoſt as properly ſay of him that Dreams, that he Eats and Drinks, Fights or Travels, or whatever he Fancies himſelf to do, as we can of this ſort of Sluggard that he lives. 'Tis true, could a Man be for ever Impertinent, this ſort of Idleneſs would ſeem to ſome Men to have no great Evil in it; but how could ſuch a Mind bear the ſhock of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Misfortunes? How could ſuch a Soul diſcharge the great Duties of Humane Society? How could it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf with Objects agreeable to a Rational Nature? And if it could do none of theſe things, 'tis impoſſible to conceive how it could be other than miſerable; for thô we could ſuppoſe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:39250:129"/>
ſuch a Creature to be ſo meer a Trifle as never to be nearly concerned in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Changes of Fortune, nor ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by that Community he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, that is, I ſhould almoſt ſay, never to be regarded or minded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God or Man; yet ſtill ſuch a one did no way live up to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of his Nature, his Buſineſs and Enjoyment were not Manly and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and his Childiſh Life were therefore only pretty and pleaſing to him, becauſe he had a childiſh and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Grave much better than the gay <hi>Impertinent;</hi> or the Man of Buſineſs, if he neglect the main, the one thing neceſſary, to be preferred before the Man of Mode: Senſuality, 'tis true, ſoftens, and Drudgery hardens the Mind, but both alike intoxicate it, both wed it to this, and alienate it from the other World: It imports very little to what Idol one do Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, whether <hi>Aſhtaroth, Molock,</hi> or <hi>Mammon,</hi> if we Sacrifice not to the true God. In vain do they pretend to any other Art, who are ignorant
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:39250:130"/>
of the Art of Living, to plod or drudge, intriegue or trade, canvas and court, 'tis all but ſolemn Impertinence, if Vertue and Religion be neglected: Ah! what Phantoms, and Clouds, and Dreams do Men purſue and hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inſtead of Life and Peace, of Reſt and Pleaſure!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Remiſneſs or Lukewarmneſs in Religion, a ſort of Neutrality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Vice and Vertue is the next thing to be avoided: We can never truly Live, unleſs we be intirely U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, unleſs we be wholly given up, and without reſerve, to the Conduct of Reaſon: There is little Pleaſure in Religion, if there be no ardour and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in it; 'tis Love makes the Duty eaſie, and the Proſpect delightful.
